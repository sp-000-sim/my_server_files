  "abstract_text": "\n     Disclosed is a polymeric, ionic compound comprising imidazolium groups, which compound is obtainable by simultaneously reacting glyoxal, formaldehyde, at least one C 4 -Csalkylene diamine, and at least one protic acid, especially by simultaneously reacting glyoxal, formaldehyde, hexylene diamine, and acetic acid in the presence of a polar solvent. The polymeric ionic compound is characterized in that its number average molecular weight is from the range 2500 to 19000 g/mol and its polydispersity is from the range 2 to 9. It shows advantageous antimicrobial properties, and may be used in various formulations for application fields including plant protection, personal care, home care, industrial or institutional or hospital disinfection, material protection, or pharmaceuticals. \n   \n   ",
