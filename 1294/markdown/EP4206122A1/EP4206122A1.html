<h2>Description</h2><h3><u>PERTINENT ART</u></h3><p>5 [0001] The claimed invention relates to the chemical industry and can be used in the production of an aqueous chlorine dioxide solution for disinfection, water purification, sterilization and bleaching.</p><h3><u>PRIOR ART</u></h3><p>10 [0002] There is a method of producing an aqueous chlorine dioxide solution which comprises the following stages: a) producing chloride, B) producing peroxodisulfate, c) combining chloride and peroxodisulfate in an aqueous system with a molar ratio of peroxodisulfate to chloride <math>[S_2O_8^{2-}]/[ClO_2^-]</math> greater than 1 with the formation of an aqueous chlorine dioxide solution, where no additional buffer is added to produce an aqueous chlorine dioxide solution (RF Patent No. 2567937, 2015).</p><p>15 [0003] The disadvantage of this method is the formation of destabilizing side products, such as hypochloride and chlorine, which do not allow maintaining the stability of the chlorine dioxide solution without the use of cooling devices and overpressure for a long time, as well as the absence of stabilizing substances.</p><p>20 [0004] There is also a known method for producing stable and pure liquid chlorine dioxide, which includes the combination of two components in an aqueous solution, one being textone sodium salt (sodium chloride, NaClO<sub>2</sub>), and the other being sodium peroxodisulfate (sodium persulfate, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) or sodium hydrosulfate (sodium bisulfate, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>). At the first stage an aqueous textone sodium salt solution is prepared, at the second stage an aqueous sodium peroxodisulfate solution or an aqueous sodium hydrosulfate solution is prepared, and at the third stage the aqueous solutions produced at the first and second stages are combined (international application WO2011086579, 2011).</p><p>25 [0005] The disadvantage of this method is the lack of stability during preparation (there is no release of carbon dioxide when the components are combined), as well as the inability to maintain the stability of the chlorine dioxide solution for more than 30 days.</p><p>30 [0006] There is also a known method for producing chlorine dioxide mixed with oxygen by the reaction of chloride with peroxymonosulfate in the presence of a redox initiating agent in an acidic aqueous solution (international application WO03055797, 2003).</p><p>35 [0007] The disadvantage of this method is the low (acidic) pH of the chlorine dioxide solution, which contributes to the destabilization of chlorine dioxide due to the formation of chlorous acid HClO<sub>2</sub>, which, in turn, decomposes into hydrochloric HCl and chloric acid HClO<sub>3</sub>. In addition, the chlorine dioxide solution contains such a destabilizing side product as hydrogen peroxide.</p><p>40 [0008] There is also a method for producing chlorine dioxide which comprises producing an aqueous persulfate solution with a concentration of 0.01-1.0 mole of persulfate per liter, which is buffered to a pH of 3-9; producing an aqueous chloride solution with a concentration of 0.01-1.0 mole of chloride per liter, which is buffered to a pH of 9-12; mixing a persulfate solution with chloride solution with a molar ratio of persulfate to chloride being greater than 2 (US Patent US7303737, 2007).</p><p>45 [0009] The disadvantage of this method is the formation of destabilizing side products, such as an excess of persulfate, which forms an acidic medium and causes the formation of chlorous acid HClO<sub>2</sub>, which, in turn, decomposes into hydrochloric HCl and chloric acid HClO<sub>3</sub>.</p><h3><u>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</u></h3><p>45 [0010] The technical issue solved by the claimed invention is to develop a method for producing a stabilized aqueous chlorine dioxide solution, which can be stored at a temperature up to 30°C and normal atmospheric pressure for at least 12 months.</p><p>50 [0011] The technical result provided by the claimed invention is to maximize the production of the final product (chlorine dioxide) without destabilizing side products.</p><p>55 [0012] The specified technical result is achieved by the fact that in the method for producing a stabilized aqueous chlorine dioxide solution which includes the interaction of two aqueous solutions, one of the solutions (A) is produced by means of dissolving metallic or ammonium chloride (A1), metallic or ammonium carbonate (A2) and metallic or ammonium bicarbonate (A3) in water, with the mass ratio of metallic or ammonium chloride (A1) to metallic or ammonium carbonate or metallic or ammonium bicarbonate (A2+A3) being 2.4-3.0 : 1, and the second of the solutions (B) is produced by means of dissolving metallic or ammonium persulfate (B1) and metallic or ammonium bisulfate (B2) in water, with the mass ratio of metallic or ammonium persulfate (B1) to metallic or ammonium bisulfate (B2) being 3:1.</p><p>60 [0013] The technical result is also achieved by the fact that the mass ratio of the components is as follows (mass %):</p>

To do this, one takes suitable containers made of chemically resistant material, for example, high-density polyethylene (HDP) or unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC-U), or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Distilled lukewarm water is used for solutions.</p><p>[0022] To produce the first solution (A), metallic or ammonium chloride (A1), metallic or ammonium carbonate (A2) and metallic or ammonium bicarbonate (A3) are dissolved in water, with the mass ratio (A1) to (A2 +A3) being 2.4-3.0 : 1.

Metallic or ammonium carbonate with metallic or ammonium bicarbonate are also dissolved in water gradually - first in a small amount of water, then the resulting solution is poured into a container with dissolved metallic or ammonium chloride.

The solution is left in the container for 48 hours at room temperature (20-25 °C). During this time, if possible, the container is shaken for more efficient reactions.</p><p>[0031] Herewith, the following chemical reactions occur:</p><math display="block">E_{(2/k)}S_2O_8 + (2/k)E(ClO_2)_k = 2ClO_2 + 2E_{(2/k)}SO_4</math><math display="block">5E(ClO_2)_k + 4E(HSO_4)_k = 4KClO_2 + 4kE_{(2/k)}SO_4 + 2kH_2O + 3Cl_k</math><math display="block">2E_{(2/k)}CO_3(\text{excess}) + (2/k)E(HSO_4)_k = E_{(2/k)}CO_3(\text{remainder}) + 2E_{(2/k)}SO_4 +</math><math display="block">CO_2 + H_2O</math><math display="block">E(HSO_4)_k + E(HCO_3)_k - kE_{(2/k)}SO_4 + kH_2O + kCO_2^2</math><p>where E is a metallic or ammonium cation, k is a coefficient equal to 1 or 2 depending on the valence.</p><p>[0032] Thus, a chlorine dioxide solution is formed, which contains a small amount of sulfate, chloride and carbon dioxide as side products, with carbon dioxide evaporating from the solution upon completion of the reactions. Also, a small amount of carbonate remains in the solution, since only part of the carbonate reacts. These side products do not destabilize chlorine dioxide. Herewith, a slightly alkaline medium of the solution is maintained, which prevents the chlorine dioxide from decomposition into hydrochloric and chloric acids. This is what ensures the stability of chlorine dioxide.</p><p>[0033] Simultaneous use of persulfate and bisulfate in solution (B) increases the yield of chlorine dioxide and allows reactions to occur at room temperature.</p><p>[0034] Simultaneous use of carbonate and bicarbonate in solution (A) allows to regulate the pH of the solution (the concentration of hydroxyl ions (<math>OH^-</math>) and reduce the amount of sulfate ions in the solution. The gradual dissolution of a mixture of carbonate and bicarbonate leads to the formation of metallic ion aqueous complexes that attract hydroxyl ions (<math>OH^-</math>), thereby creating a slightly alkaline environment that helps stabilize the solution in the long term.</p><p>[0035] The simultaneous use of carbonate and bisulfate also leads to the formation of carbon dioxide, which prevents the decomposition of chlorine dioxide at the preparing stage.</p><p>[0036] In addition, due to the specified mass ratio of components, the maximum production of the final product (chlorine dioxide) is ensured with optimal pH stabilization.</p><h2>EMBODIMENT OF INVENTION</h2><p>[0037] The invention can be illustrated, but not limited to the following examples of its specific implementation.</p><p>Example 1.</p><p>[0038] To produce the first solution (A), a 1.5-liter HDP container (container No. 1) is taken and 15 ml of lukewarm water is poured into it.
