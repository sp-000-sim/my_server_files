<h2>Description</h2><p>[0001] The present invention relates to a polymer having antimicrobial and/or antifouling (protein-resistant) properties, to monomers that can be used in a method of producing the polymer of the invention, and to a use of the polymer of the invention, including a method for coating the surface of a material, substrate or product with the polymer of the invention, as well as to products comprising the polymer of the invention and/or to a coating comprising the polymer of the invention.</p><h2>Prior Art</h2><p>[0002] Since the discovery of penicillin by Fleming in 1928, antibiotics have gained an ever increasing importance in the fight against infectious diseases caused by bacteria. The first antibiotic was tested 1941 with human patients. Soon, antibiotics became the regular treatment even for minor infections. This led to the formation of resistance against antibiotics among an ever increasing number of bacterial strains, causing massive problems in public institutions such as hospitals, schools and homes for the elderly, where bacteria can easily spread. In 2011, there were about 25 000 deaths that could be clearly related to bacterial infections in the European Union, and the number of annual deaths in the USA is estimated to about 100 000. At the same time, only few new antibiotic substance classes have been developed in the last decades, and those that were had severe side effects. Novel antibiotic substances, particularly such that do not cause antibiotic resistance, are thus direly needed.</p><p>[0003] Synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMPs) could meet this need. SMAMPs are molecules that imitate the properties of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a class of compounds that are part of the immune system of multicellular organisms. AMPs are facially amphiphilic molecules that are able to selectively attack bacteria, but not mammalian cells. While antibiotics have defined cell targets, typically receptors, AMPs act unspecifically and use the physical properties of the cell to operate. With their hydrophilic, cationic groups, they attach to the outer envelope of negatively charged bacterial cells. They then cluster and insert their hydrophobic groups through the lipid bilayer of the bacterial membrane. This causes either pore formation or rupture of the bacteria, associated with leakage of cytoplasm and cell death or at least bacteriostasis. Because of this unspecific mode of action, so far there are only very few reports of bacterial resistance against AMPs. These involve changes of the chemistry and/or charge of the bacterial envelope; however, these AMP-resistant bacteria could so far not prevail in the evolutionary competition with non-resistant strains. Considering the time-span of evolution, the resistance rate against AMPs is thus negligible, compared to today's resistance rates against antibiotics.</p><p>[0004] Several families of synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides that imitate the properties and mechanism of action of AMPs have been reported so far: for example, Tew and Lienkamp reported poly(oxonorbornene) based SMAMPs (cf. e.g. Lienkamp et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130(30), 9836); Kuroda and DeGrado reported methacrylate based SMAMPs (cf. e.g. Kuroda, K.; DeGrado, W.F., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127(12), 4128); and Gellman and coworkers reported nylon-3 based SMAMPs (cf. e.g. Mowery et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129(50), 15474). Each of these systems has strong features, such as high antimicrobial activity; however, there are also substantial drawbacks. For example, while some of the poly(oxonorbornene) SMAMPs consists of facially amphiphilic repeat units, which is crucial to achieve cell selectivity, they require a metal catalyst for their synthesis that may be difficult to remove, and some of these SMAMPs undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions that limits their applications. The methacrylate SMAMPs do not require a metal catalyst but can be obtained by simple free radical polymerization; however, they consist of hydrophobic and hydrophilic co-repeat units instead of amphiphilic monomers. This causes hydrophobic domains in the polymer chain, which mediates cell toxicity towards mammalian cells and severely limits the cell selectivity of these polymers. The nylon-3 polymers also consist of co-repeat units, but thanks to their generally more hydrophilic backbone the cell selectivity is not as adversely affected as the methacrylates. Their precursors, however, are difficult to synthesize (cf. e.g. Lee et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131(46), 16779). Additionally, all of the above examples rely on polymers that are mainly obtained from fossil fuels.</p><p>[0005] Several studies have shown that SMAMPs operate in a similar way as AMPs (cf. e.g. Al-Ahmad et al., PLoS One 2013, 8(9), e73812, A. E. Madkour, A. H. R. Koch, K. Lienkamp, G. N. Tew, Macromolecules 2010, 43, 4557-4561), thus it is clear that these substances are promising materials in the fight against multiresistant bacteria if the drawbacks that limit their application can be solved.</p><p>[0006] Further information on SMAMPs is published in: K. Lienkamp, G. N. Tew, Chemistry - A European Journal 2009, 15, 11784-11800; K. Lienkamp, A. E. Madkour, G. N. Tew, Advances in Polymer Science 2013, 251, 141-172; W. Hu, A. Som, G. N. Tew, J. Phys.

The synthesized copolymers have cationic and hydrophobic groups randomly distributed along the polymer chain according to formula IIIa as in § [0107].</p><p>[0008] JP 2000 007505 A discloses an antibacterial agent comprising a polymer having a repeating unit represented by a general formula (a) having a quaternary amine in the side chain (cf. claim 1).</p><p>[0009] US 5 208 016 A relates to an antimicrobial substance containing an ethylene copolymer of at least one di-alkylaminoalkylacrylamide comonomer as represented in a formula (I) (cf. columns 1, I. 50-63). D3 discloses an aqueous dispersion of the cationic polymer obtained by reacting the described ethylene copolymer with hydrochloric acid to form a quaternary salt (cf. column 2, I. 3-10).</p><p>[0010] EP 2 636 693 A1 relates to a crosslinked network of covalently attached antimicrobial and/or antibiofouling polymers obtained by ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and having exhibit a molecular weight of more than 1,000 g mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p><h3>Problem to be Solved by the Present Invention</h3><p>[0011] In view of the above problems associated with the SMAMPs of the prior art, there is a continuous need for novel polymer-based synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMPs) that (a) are stable under physiological conditions and typical conditions for biomedical applications (medication formulations, surfaces coatings, sterilization conditions, storage conditions); (b) consists of facially amphiphilic repeat units to enable fine-tuning of the biological properties of the resulting polymer, so that cell toxicity can be avoided; (c) can be polymerized by standard polymerization methods using a non-toxic, preferentially non-metal based polymerization initiator that remains covalently attached to the polymer chain and thus does not have to be removed from the polymer by laborious work-up; (d) are based on a flexible synthetic platform and can be obtained in a few easy synthetic steps; and (e) are preferentially obtained from components that are available from renewable resources.</p><p>[0012] Advantageously, the new SMAMPs should be based on a source independent of mineral oil. Moreover, it should be possible to prepare the new SMAMPs without the need for reagents, which are too hazardous, toxic, or the like, in order to avoid a contamination of the SMAMPs, e.g. by (heavy) metals, or the like. Moreover, the new SMAMP should be producible in a cost-efficient manner and allow for industrial production. Advantageously, the new SMAMPs should allow the coating of a surface, e.g., of a material, substrate or product, in order to provide said material, substrate or product with a surface having antimicrobial and/or antifouling (protein-repellant) properties.</p><p>[0013] Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel polymer-based synthetic mimic of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMPs), which fulfills all of the above requirements.</p><p>[0014] This object is solved by the subject matter of the attached claims. The different embodiments as described in the following description can be suitably combined with each other.</p><h3>Summary of the Invention</h3><p>[0015] The present invention, as defined by the appended claims, provides a polymer, which has antimicrobial and/or antifouling (protein-repellant) properties and is useful as a synthetic mimic of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMP).</p><h3>Brief Description of Figures</h3><p>[0016]</p><p>Figure 1 shows the antimicrobial activity of Series 1 copolymers against E. coli (cf.

<p>radiation. Preferably, crosslinking is caused by irradiation with microwaves, NIR, visible or UV radiation, or the like, more preferably by irradiation with UV radiation. Suitable photo-crosslinking moieties are well-known to a person skilled in the art, e.g. from G.T. Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques, 3rd Edition, Academic Press, 2013, or V.V. Krongauz, A.D. Trifunac, Processes in Photo-reactive Polymers, Chapman &amp; Hall, 1995; or Reiser/Arnost; Photo-reactive Polymers: The Science and Technology of Resists, Wiley Interscience, 1989. Preferably, a photo-crosslinking moiety comprises a suitable photo-reactive group, e.g. a group comprising an aryl azide group (e.g. phenyl azides), an azide group, a diazo group, a diazirine group, a ketone group, a quinone group, an organic dye, or the like. Upon "activation" with an appropriate energy source, the photo-reactive group generates an active species such as, e.g., a radical or biradical, including, for example, a nitrene, carbene, excited states of ketone, or the like.</p><p>[0110] Preferably, the photo-crosslinking moiety comprises an aryl ketone group, such as acetophenone, benzophenone, anthrone, and anthrone-like heterocycles (i.e., heterocyclic analogs of anthrone such as those having N, O, or S in the 10-position), or their substituted (e.g., ring substituted) derivatives. Examples of aryl ketones include heterocyclic derivatives of anthrone, including acridone, xanthone, and thioxanthone, and their ring substituted derivatives. Other suitable photo-crosslinking moieties comprise quinone such as, for example, anthraquinone. The functional groups of such aryl ketones can undergo multiple activation/inactivation/reactivation cycles. For example, benzophenone is capable of photochemical excitation with the initial formation of an excited singlet state that undergoes intersystem crossing to the triplet state. The excited triplet state can insert into carbon-hydrogen bonds by abstraction of a hydrogen atom (e.g., from a polymer, from a (pretreated) substrate and/or from a polymeric coating layer), thus creating a radical pair. Subsequent collapse of the radical pair leads to formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. If a reactive bond (e.g., carbon/hydrogen) is not available for bonding, the ultraviolet light-induced excitation of the benzophenone group is reversible and the molecule returns to ground state energy level upon removal of the energy source.</p><p>[0111] Alternatively, the photo-reactive crosslinking moiety may comprise a function selected from e.g. arylazide (<math>C_6R_5N_3</math>) such as phenyl azide and 4-fluoro-3-nitrophenyl azide; acyl azide (<math>-CO-N_3</math>) such as benzoyl azide and p-methylbenzoyl azide; azidoformate (<math>-O-CO-N_3</math>) such as ethyl azidoformate and phenyl azidoformate; sulfonyl azide (<math>-SO_2-N_3</math>) such as benzenesulfonyl azide; and phosphoryl azide (<math>RO_2PON_3</math>) such as diphenyl phosphoryl azide and diethyl phosphoryl azide. Diazo compounds constitute another class of photo-reactive groups and include diazoalkanes (<math>-CHN_2</math>) such as diazomethane and diphenyldiazomethane; diazoketones (<math>-C(=O)-CHN_2</math>) such as diazoacetophenone and 1-trifluoromethyl-1-diazo-2-pentanone; diazoacetates (<math>-O-C(=O)-CHN_2</math>) such as t-butyl diazoacetate and phenyl diazoacetate; and beta-keto-alpha-diazoacetates (<math>-C(=O)-CN_2-C(=O)-O-</math>) such as t-butyl alpha diazoacetoacetate; etc. R may be preferably hydrogen or an alkyl as defined above. Other photo-reactive groups include the diazirines (<math>-CHN_2</math>) such as 3-trifluoromethyl-3-phenyldiazirine; and ketenes (<math>-CH-C(=O)-</math>) such as ketene and diphenylketene.</p><p>[0112] Advantageously, the inventive polymer comprising a repeat unit C with a photo-crosslinking moiety can be photo-crosslinked by itself. Thus, no external photo-crosslinker must be added. However, the inventive photo-crosslinkable polymer can also be used in combination with a suitable external photo-crosslinker, which may be selected from any suitable compound forming covalent bonds to a substrate and/or the polymer of the invention upon subjecting the compound to radiation, as defined above. For example, the inventive photo-crosslinkable polymer can be attached to the surface of a substrate by radiation if the surface of the substrate is previously provided with a suitable photo-crosslinker, for example <math>(EtO)_3-Si-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-O-C_6H_4-C(=O)-C_6H_5</math>, or the like.

Preferably, crosslinking is caused by heating in the range of from 40 to 200°C, more preferably in the range of from 60 to 120°C. In the context of the present invention, such a thermo-crosslinking moiety or thermo-crosslinker may be selected from any suitable compound forming covalent bonds to a substrate and/or the polymer of the invention upon subjecting the compound to heat treatment. Suitable thermo-crosslinking or thermo-setting groups are known in the art, e.g. from H. Dodiuk / S. Goodman, Handbook of Thermoset Plastics, 3rd Edition, 2013.</p><p>[0114] Advantageously, the inventive polymer comprising a repeat unit C with a thermocrosslinking moiety can be thermally crosslinked by itself.

However, the inventive thermocrosslinkable polymer can also be used in combination with a suitable external thermocrosslinker, which may be selected from any suitable compound forming covalent bonds to a substrate and/or the polymer of the invention upon subjecting the compound to heat, as defined above.

Itaconic acid is the trivial name for 2-methylene butane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid. The chemistry and polymerization behavior of itaconic acid and its anhydride are well-known in the art. Itaconic acid is a dicarboxylic acid that can be polymerized by radical polymerization. Several initiators, including potassium peroxodisulfate, dibenzoyl peroxide, and azoisobutyric acid nitrile have since then been reported as initiators for the radical polymerization of itaconic acid (cf. e.g. Braun and Sayed, Die Makromolekulare Chemie 1966, 96(1), 100; Hirano, Higashi, Seno, Sato, Journal of Polymer Science, Part A: Polymer Chemistry (2004), 42(19), 4895-4905; Hirano, Higashi, Seno, Makiko, Sato, European Polymer Journal (2003), 39(9), 1801-1808, Katime, Palomares, Cesteros, Laborra, Dominguez, Thermochimica Acta (1988), 132, 193-203; Katime, Palomares, Cesteros, Laborra, Dominguez, Thermochimica Acta (1989), 142(2), 317-28; Katime, Madoz, Velada, Thermochimica Acta (1993), 220(1-2), 91-101). Important references of the patent literature include U.S. Pat. No. 3,560,529, which describes the polymerization of itaconic anhydride using a mixed itaconic-acyl peroxide; U.S. Pat. No. 3,055,873, which describes the polymerization of monoalkyl itaconate at 60°C using 0.5% dibenzoyl peroxide as initiator (75% conversion after only 2 hours); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,592, which describes the polymerization of neutralized itaconic acid at 90°C using sodium peroxodisulfate as initiator, and feeding the initiator and monomer solutions linearly over 2 hours, which gave about 98% conversion, even though the obtained molecular masses M<sub>n</sub>, determined by gel permeation chromatography, were low.</p><p>[0159] One special feature of itaconic acid is that, being a side product in the Krebs cycle, it is non-toxic for humans. Industrially, itaconic acid is produced by fermentation of carbohydrates, e.g. molasses, using microorganisms (e.g. <i>Aspergillus</i>). Polyitaconic acid derivatives are currently used in shampoos (sulfonated polyitaconic acid), the polyitaconic esters are used as plastics, glues and coatings, artificial gems and glasses, and dental materials (cf. e.g. Okabe et al., Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2009, 84(4), 597; Hajian et al., Current Research Journal of Biological Sciences 2015, 7(2), 37).</p><p>[0160] In summary, itaconic acid and its derivatives are a cheap, non-toxic and sustainable starting material and thus an ideal candidate for the synthesis of polymers that are intended for use in medical products. The itaconic-acid based bioactive polymers of the present invention are either antimicrobially active or antifouling/protein-repellent (i.e. they prevent biofilm formation), or both, as specified in the claims and examples.</p><p>[0161] A monomer for repeat unit A represented by general formula (X-a), (X-b), (X-c), (X-d), (X-e) or (X-f) can be prepared, e.g., by addition of corresponding residues to itaconic acid or an itaconic acid derivative, respectively. Suitable reactions result in the formation of a corresponding ester, amide, etc., function connecting the respective residues to itaconic acid or the itaconic acid derivative, such as, e.g., itaconic acid anhydride, or the like. Suitable reactions for producing the respective linkage on basis of an ester, amide, or the like, are well-known to a person skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, for example as described in R. Brückner, Reaktionsmechanismen, 3rd Ed., Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, 2009.</p><p>[0162] For example, the residue R<sup>1</sup> or R<sup>2</sup> can be introduced by nucleophilic substitution, or another (catalyzed) substitution reaction.

Suitable catalysts are well-known to a person skilled in the art. For example, an acid catalyst can be used in an esterification reaction, such as, e.g., an inorganic acid, e.g., HCl, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or the like, and a base catalyst can be used in an amidification reaction, such as, e.g., 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), or the like, etc.</p><p>[0165] For example, an <math>\omega</math>-boc-amino alkylamine, such as, e.g., <math>\omega</math>-N-boc-2-amino ethylamine, or a boc-protected <math>\omega</math>-guanidino alkylamine, or a boc-protected <math>\omega</math>-biguanidino alkylamine, and the like, can be used to prepare a residue R<sup>1</sup> represented by general formula (II) or (III) by formation of an amine bond with itaconic acid or a derivative thereof.

Surfaces or substrates may also include any substrate or surface used for storage of cells, tissue, organs, etc., but also any substrate or surface used for storage of food, such as refrigerators, coolers, storage boxes, etc.</p><p>[0223] For the purposes of the present invention, such a surface or (surface of a) substrate as defined herein may be pretreated to allow covalent binding of the polymer of the invention. More preferably, the surface as defined above may be pretreated in two steps. The first step (defined as Step I) may allow binding of a reactive compound, e.g. a reactive silane compound or a photo-reactive silane compound or a thermo-reactive silane compound, or a photo-reactive thiol/disulfide, or a thermo-reactive thiol/disulfide, or a photo-reactive alkenyl, vinyl or acryl compound, or a thermo-reactive alkenyl, vinyl or acryl compound, to the surface or (surface of a) substrate as defined herein. After this pretreatment, the actual reactive compound as defined above is attached (defined as Step II). Preferably, Step I modifies the surface to comprise, e.g., oxide or hydroxide groups, thiol moieties, etc. It thus allows binding reactive compounds by reacting with the oxide or hydroxide groups or with thiol groups on the surface. Accordingly, the surface may be treated prior to binding of the polymer of the invention to generate e.g. hydroxide or oxide groups, e.g. with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, oxygen plasma, air plasma, UV, ozone, UV-ozone, heat, open flame, and the like, or with analogous methods to generate thiol groups. In the case of a metal, the metal can be subject to an oxidizing potential to generate oxide or hydroxide sites on the surface of the metal. In the case of an organic material, the organic material may be likewise pretreated to comprise e.g. oxide or hydroxide groups, etc. Alternatively, the organic material already comprises e.g. oxide or hydroxide groups, thiol moieties, etc.</p><p>[0224] Preferably, in Step II, a reactive compound as defined above is reacted with the surface or (surface of a)</p>

<!-- Page 30 -->

<p>substrate as defined herein. This reactive compound carries one moiety that can attach to said surface, and another moiety that can attach to the inventive polymer. It thus enables covalent binding between the oxide, thiol or other functional group on the surface, and the inventive polymer. This reactive compound is termed "surface crosslinker" in the following. It is to be distinguished from the crosslinking repeat units C of the inventive polymer defined above, or the "external" crosslinkers added to the inventive polymer to enable the network-formation of the inventive polymers that have been defined above.</p><p>[0225] Just like the external crosslinkers and the crosslinking repeat units C of the inventive polymer, the surface crosslinker may be activated thermally or photochemically. In the context of surface immobilization, the term "photo-crosslinking" typically means covalently attaching the polymer of the invention to a (pretreated) surface as defined herein via a photo-reactive surface crosslinker. For this purpose, the surface, which may have been pretreated with a process according to Step I, may be preferably further functionalized with a photo-reactive surface crosslinker, which is specified below.</p><p>[0226] If an additional external photo-crosslinker or a photo-crosslinkable repeat unit C is present in the inventive polymer, said polymer is immobilized on the surface as a network. If no external photo-crosslinker or photo-crosslinkable repeat unit C is present in the inventive polymer, said polymer is immobilized on the surface as a monolayer.</p><p>[0227] In the context of surface immobilization, the term "thermo-crosslinking" means covalently attaching the polymer of the invention to a (pretreated) surface as defined herein via a thermo-reactive surface-crosslinker. For this purpose, the surface which may have been pretreated with a process according to Step I may be preferably further functionalized with a thermo-reactive surface-crosslinker. If an additional external thermo-crosslinker or a thermo-crosslinkable repeat unit C is present in the inventive polymer, said polymer immobilized on the surface as a network. If no external thermo-crosslinker or thermo-crosslinkable repeat unit C is present in the inventive polymer, said polymer is immobilized on the surface as a monolayer.</p><p>[0228] The "photo-crosslinking" and "thermo-crosslinking" may also be combined. For example, the surface attachment may simultaneously or sequentially proceed via a thermo-reactive surface-crosslinker and a photo-reactive surface-crosslinker. Further, the network formation of the inventive polymer may simultaneously or sequentially proceed via a thermo-reactive external crosslinker and a photo-reactive external crosslinker, and/or via the presence of a thermo-crosslinkable repeat unit C in the inventive polymer and/or a photo-crosslinkable repeat unit C in the inventive polymer.</p><p>[0229] In this context, a suitable photo-reactive surface crosslinker may be covalently attached to such a (pretreated) surface, and may comprise, without being limited thereto, e.g. any silane, thiol or disulfide compound, preferably as mentioned herein, which has at least one photo-reactive group thereon and allows formation of a covalent bond between said photo-reactive group and the inventive polymer. For example, the photo-reactive surface-crosslinker may comprise at least one photo-reactive group as defined herein, and at least one of the group of silane compounds. Silane compounds are defined by having mono-, di-, or tri-alkoxyl silane moieties and/or mono-, di-, or tri-chlorosilane moieties, preferably silane compounds having at least one tri(<math>C_1</math>-<math>C_3</math>)alkoxysilyl group and/or at least one chlorosilane group. Suitable tri(<math>C_1</math>-<math>C_3</math>)alkoxysilyl groups include e.g. trimethoxysilyl, triethoxysilyl, and tripropoxysilyl, and combinations thereof. More preferably, the photo-reactive surface crosslinker may comprise, e.g., triethoxysilane-<math>CH_2</math>-<math>CH_2</math>-<math>CH_2</math>-O-benzophenone, (4-benzoylbenzoyl)amino(<math>C_1</math>-<math>C_3</math>)alkyltri(<math>C_1</math>-<math>C_3</math>)alkoxy silane, (4-benzoylbenzoyl)aminopropyltrimethoxy silane, (4-benzoylbenzoyl)aminoethyltrimethoxy silane, and 4-(3'-chlorodimethylsilyl)propyloxybenzophenone. Also suitable are the corresponding thiol, dithiol or disulfide compounds, for example the compound depicted in formula (XII):</p><img alt="Chemical structure of compound (XII). It features a benzophenone moiety (two phenyl rings connected by a carbonyl group) linked via an ester bond to a four-carbon alkyl chain, which is attached to a five-membered ring containing a disulfide group (S-S)."/>(XII)<p>[0230] Alternatively, the photo-reactive surface cross-linker may contain any functional group that can participate in a photo-activated reaction with any of the residues of repeat units A, B, or C of the inventive polymer, and one of the moiety defined above (silane, thiol, disulfide, etc.) that can be used to attach the photo-reactive surface cross-linker to the (pretreated) surface as defined above.</p><p>[0231] Binding of the photo-reactive surface crosslinker to the (pretreated) surface preferably occurs via its silane moiety, if a silane compound is used, alternative via any further functionality, if a non-silane compound is used, e.g. hydroxyl moieties, -C(O)OH moieties, etc., or any further functional moiety of these crosslinkers suitable to bind to the pretreated surface. Furthermore, binding of the polymer of the invention preferably occurs via the at least one photo-reactive moiety of the photo-reactive surface crosslinker.</p><p>[0232] If the polymer of the present invention consisting of different repeat units <math>A_i</math>, <math>B_i</math> or <math>C_i</math>, carries a residue containing</p>

<!-- Page 31 -->

<p>a double bond or triple bond on any of these repeat units, for example, if <math>R^1</math> or <math>R^2</math> of any of the repeat units <math>A_i</math> comprise an alkenyl or alkynyl residue as defined above, they may react with a photo-reactive surface crosslinker that contains a moiety that can be used to attach the photo-reactive surface-crosslinker to the (pretreated) surface as defined above, and an additional (protected) thiol or disulfide group. In this case, the (pretreated) surface would be first reacted with the silane, disulfide or thiol moiety of the photo-reactive surface crosslinker. Said cross-linker would then optionally be deprotected or reduced on the surface to form the desired thiol group. That thiol group would then be reacted with the alkenyl or alkynyl moiety of the inventive polymer by photoactivation, preferably UV irradiation, in a thiol-ene reaction. Thus, a surface-attached monolayer of the inventive polymer can be produced on the surface.</p><p>[0233] For example, if either <math>A_i</math>, <math>B_i</math>, or <math>C_i</math> carry a residue containing a SH group, for example if <math>R^1</math> or <math>R^2</math> of any of the repeat units <math>A_i</math> comprise an alkyl thiol, preferably a <math>C_1</math> to <math>C_6</math> alkyl <math>\omega</math>-thiol, more preferably a <math>CH_2CH_2SH</math>, or <math>CH_2CH_2CH_2SH</math>, they may react with a photo-reactive surface-crosslinker (containing a moiety to attach said surface-crosslinker to the surface), and an additional alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, vinylbenzene, divinylbenzene, trivinylbenzene group or the like on that surface-crosslinker, in a photoactivated thiol-ene-reaction.</p><p>[0234] The functional group that is used for the reaction with the photo-reactive surface crosslinker may have to be present in a protected form until after the radical polymerization reaction, using protected groups known to a skilled expert, as specified, for example, in Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (cf. complete citation above).

After polymerization, the protective groups are then removed using a method known to the skilled expert, so that the cross-linking functionality becomes available, without otherwise altering the chemical integrity of the polymer structure.</p><p>[0239] A suitable catalyst may be added to the photo-crosslinking mixture.</p><h4>External photo-crosslinker:</h4><p>[0240] Thiol compounds suitable for network formation via photo-crosslinking may be selected from any (photo-reactive) thiol crosslinker bearing at least two thiol groups, preferably (photo-reactive) di-, tri-, tetrafunctional or multifunctional thiol crosslinker as defined herein and/or from adducts/condensation products of photo-reactive compounds and thiol compounds, e.g. an condensation product between benzophenone or any and a thiol-crosslinker as defined herein.</p><p>[0241] According to an alternative aspect of the photo-crosslinking approach, the (pretreated) surface may be functionalized with a reactive silane, thiol or disulfide compound as defined herein, which does not comprise a photo-reactive moiety. In this context, the reactive silane, thiol or disulfide compound is preferably covalently attached to the (pretreated) surface as defined herein in a first step. Then, preferably, a photo-reactive surface crosslinker is bound to the silane, thiol or disulfide e.g. via a reactive moiety of the silane, thiol or disulfide, e.g. an SH moiety, a hydroxyl moiety, a <math>-C(O)OH</math> moiety, etc. In a final step, the polymer of the invention is then covalently attached to the surface via the photo-reactive moiety of the photo-reactive surface crosslinker in a photo-crosslinking reaction, e.g. via UV activation. The same applies analogously for a UV-activated thiol ene reaction between the silane and the inventive polymer.</p>

<!-- Page 32 -->

<p>[0242] In this context, a reactive silane compound, which does not comprise a photo-reactive moiety and which may be covalently attached to the (pretreated) surface as defined herein in a first step, is preferably selected from silane compounds having at least one or at least two tri(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>)alkoxysilyl groups. Such silane compounds may provide a more hydrolytically stable bond to the substrate at least because each tri(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>)alkoxysilyl group can result in a bond (Si-O-Metal) with the surface. Examples of suitable tri(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>)alkoxysilyl containing silane compounds include, but are not limited to bis(trimethoxysilyl)hexane, bis(trimethoxyisilyl)ethane, and bis(trimethoxysilylethyl)benzene, preferably 1,4-bis(trimethoxysilylethyl)benzene. Furthermore, a mixture of these reactive silane compounds, preferably of tri(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>)alkoxysilyl silane compounds, can be used. The silane compound may also include [gamma]-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, either alone or in combination with other silanes, e.g. [gamma]-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane and 1,4-bis(trimethoxysilylethyl)benzene. The silane compound may also have hydrophobic properties, e.g. selected from 3-(3-methoxy-4-methacryloxyphenyl) propyltrimethoxysilane. Additionally, the reactive silane compound may be selected from e.g. dimethyl chlorosilane, methyl dichlorosilane or trichlorosilane. In the latter cases (also for all chlorosilanes), the silanization reaction is preferably carried out under exclusion of moisture in dry toluene and in the presence of a base, e.g. triethylamine.</p><p>[0243] Furthermore, a photo-reactive crosslinking agent, which may be bound to the (preferably already covalently attached) reactive silane compound may be selected from any suitable photo-reactive crosslinking agent known to a skilled person to be photo-reactive. Furthermore, such a photo-reactive crosslinking agent has preferably at least one latent photo-reactive group that can become chemically reactive when exposed to an appropriate energy source, e.g. UV-radiation (UV-activation), visible light, microwaves, etc. As used herein, the phrase "photo-reactive group" refers to a chemical moiety that is sufficiently stable to remain in an inactive state (i.e., ground state) under normal storage conditions but that can undergo a transformation from the inactive state to an activated state when subjected to an appropriate energy source. Photo-reactive groups respond to specific applied external stimuli to undergo active species generation with resultant covalent bonding to an adjacent chemical structure, e.g., as provided by the same or a different molecule. Photo-reactive groups can thus be chosen to be responsive to an appropriate energy source, e.g. UV-radiation, visible light/radiation, microwaves, etc.</p><p>[0244] Such a photo-activation typically involves addition of an appropriate energy source as defined above, e.g. UV-radiation, visible light, microwaves, etc., preferably sufficient to allow covalent binding of the photo-reactive moiety to the inventive antimicrobial and/or antibiofouling polymer. Preferably, the inventive antimicrobial and/or antibiofouling polymer is bound via UV-radiation (UVmediated crosslinking). More preferably, the integral light intensity at the sample location is typically about 50 to 150 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, preferably about 75 to 125 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, more preferably about 90 to 110 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, e.g. about 100 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>. For UV-activation any suitable energy source may be applied known to a skilled person, e.g. a high-pressure mercury UV lamp, such as a high-pressure mercury UV lamp (e.g. 500W, preferably from Oriel), or a StrataLinker 2400 (75 W, Stratagene). UV-activation may be about 2 to 300 min, activation energy from 0.1 to 100 J cm<sup>-2</sup>.</p><p>[0245] Suitable photo-reactive groups in the context of the present invention include, for example, azides, diazoles, diazirines, ketones, and quinones. Upon "activation" with an appropriate energy source, the photo-reactive group generates an active species such as free radicals including, for example, nitrenes, carbenes, and excited states of ketones.</p><p>[0246] According to one specific aspect of the photo-crosslinking approach, each photo-reactive group on the photo-reactive crosslinking agent can abstract an atom, e.g. a hydrogen atom from an alkyl group on either the silane compounds, the hydrolysis reaction product of the silane compound, the polymeric reaction product formed from the hydrolysis reaction product of the silane compound, or a combination thereof, and/or the inventive antimicrobial or antibiofouling polymer as defined above to be covalently attached. By covalently attaching to both the silane compound and the polymer of the invention, the photo-reactive crosslinking agent promotes adhesion and/or increases binding strength when attaching the polymer of the invention to a surface as described herein.</p><p>[0247] Preferably, the photo-reactive crosslinking agent is an aryl ketone, such as acetophenone, benzophenone, anthrone, and anthrone-like heterocycles (i.e., heterocyclic analogs of anthrone such as those having N, O, or S in the 10-position), or their substituted (e.g., ring substituted) derivatives. Examples of aryl ketones include heterocyclic derivatives of anthrone, including acridone, xanthone, and thioxanthone, and their ring substituted derivatives. Other suitable photo-reactive crosslinking agents include quinone such as, for example anthraquinone. The functional groups of such aryl ketones can undergo multiple activation/inactivation/reactivation cycles. For example, benzophenone is capable of photochemical excitation with the initial formation of an excited singlet state that undergoes intersystem crossing to the triplet state. The excited triplet state can insert into carbon-hydrogen bonds by abstraction of a hydrogen atom (from a polymeric coating layer, for example), thus creating a radical pair. Subsequent collapse of the radical pair leads to formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. The radical pair, or free radical, can also be used to incite chain polymerization if the appropriate monomer species are present. If a reactive bond (e.g., carbon/hydrogen) is not available for bonding, the ultraviolet light-induced excitation of the benzophenone group is reversible and the molecule returns to ground state energy level upon removal of the energy source.</p><p>[0248] Alternatively, the photo-reactive crosslinking agent may be selected from e.g. arylazides (C<sub>6</sub>R<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>) such as</p>

<!-- Page 33 -->

<p>phenyl azide and 4-fluoro-3-nitrophenyl azide; acyl azides (-CO-N<sub>3</sub>) such as benzoyl azide and p-methylbenzoyl azide; azido formates (-O-CO-N<sub>3</sub>) such as ethyl azidoformate and phenyl azidoformate; sulfonyl azides (-SO<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>3</sub>) such as benzenesulfonyl azide; and phosphoryl azides (RO)<sub>2</sub>PON<sub>3</sub> such as diphenyl phosphoryl azide and diethyl phosphoryl azide, or diazo compounds constitute another class of photo-reactive groups and include diazoalkanes (-CHN<sub>2</sub>) such as diazomethane and diphenyldiazomethane; diazoketones (-CO-CHN<sub>2</sub>) such as diazoacetophenone and 1-trifluoromethyl-1-diazo-2-pentanone; diazoacetates (-O-CO-CHN<sub>2</sub>) such as t-butyl diazoacetate and phenyl diazoacetate; and beta-keto-alpha-diazoacetates (-CO-CN<sub>2</sub>-CO-O-) such as t-butyl alpha diazoacetoacetate; etc. R may be preferably hydrogen or an alkyl as defined above. Other photo-reactive groups include the diazirines (-CHN2) such as 3-trifluoromethyl-3-phenyldiazirine; and ketenes CH-C-O) such as ketene and diphenylketene.</p><p>[0249] Preferably, covalently attaching the polymer of the invention to a surface via photo-crosslinking, specifically to the photo-reactive group of the photo-reactive crosslinking agent, usually occurs via photoactivation involving one or more photo-reactive moieties of the photo-reactive crosslinking agent or the photo-reactive silane compound.</p><p>[0250] According to a further aspect, the polymer of the invention may be covalently attached to a (pretreated) surface as defined herein via a thermo-reactive compound, preferably a thermo-crosslinker, following the afore mentioned "thermocrosslinking approach". For this purpose, the (pretreated) surface is preferably further functionalized with a thermo-crosslinker. In the context of the present invention, such a thermocrosslinker may be selected from any suitable compound forming covalent bonds to a substrate and/or the polymer of the invention upon subjecting the compound to heat treatment, e.g. Cl(Me)<sub>2</sub>-Si-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-SO<sub>3</sub>-N<sub>3</sub>, etc.</p><p>[0251] For example, if either A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>i</sub> or C<sub>i</sub> comprise a residue containing an alkyl hydroxy group, for example if R<sup>1</sup> or R<sup>2</sup> of any of the repeat units A<sub>i</sub> comprise an alkyl hydroxy group, or if any B<sub>i</sub> is 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, or the like, they may react with a thermo-reactive surface cross-linker comprising an active ester, such as, e.g., succinic ester, pentafluorophenol ester, or the like, or acid chloride, anhydride, or the like.</p><p>[0252] For example, if either A<sub>i</sub> or B<sub>i</sub> comprise a residue containing an alkyl hydroxy group, for example if R<sup>1</sup> or R<sup>2</sup> of any of the repeat units A<sub>i</sub> comprise an alkyl hydroxy group, or if any B<sub>i</sub> is 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, or the like, they may react with acryloyl chlorid, methacryloyl chloride, vinyl chloride, allyl chlorid, vinylbenzyl chloride, 2-(ethenyloxy)-1-methanesulfonate ethane diol, 2-e(ethenyloxy)-1-toluenesulfonate ethane diol, or the like, or any other reagent known to the skilled expert to introduce a vinyl, vinyether, acryl or methacryl group by post-polymerization modification. The resulting polymer is then used as a thermo-crosslinkable polymer with or without additional external thermo-crosslinker. Examples for such an external thermocrosslinker are compounds carrying two or more alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate groups, vinyl, allyl, vinyether, or vinylbenzyl groups, or the like, e.g. trimethylolpropane trivinyl ether, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate pentaerythritol triallyl ether, 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-trione, 2,2-Bis[4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloyloxypropyloxy) phenyl]propane, triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, triethyleneglycol diacrylate, divinylbenzene, trivinylbenzene, or any other thermo-crosslinkers known to those skilled in the art.</p><p>[0253] The functional group that is used for the reaction with the thermo-crosslinker (defined below) may have to be present in a protected form until after the radical polymerization reaction, using protected groups known to a skilled expert, as specified, for example, in Greene's Protective groups in organic synthesis (cf. complete citation above).

Alternatively, this third surface coating reaction may be carried out by using a compound comprising a thermo-crosslinker for functionalizing the pretreated surface in step b), by adding an external photo-crosslinker in step c), and by heating the surface comprising the thermo-reactive surface crosslinker, thereby covalently binding the (protected) inventive polymer to a thermo-reactive group of the thermo-reactive surface crosslinker, thereby covalently binding the inventive polymer to the surface, and subsequently irradiating the present external photo-crosslinker with UV light, thereby further crosslinking the inventive polymer to a surface attached network</p><p>[0261] In case the inventive polymer comprises repeat units C comprising a photo-crosslinking and/or thermo-crosslinking moiety, it is possible to carry out the above reactions for coating a surface with a polymer network of the inventive polymer without addition of an external photo-crosslinker and/or thermocrosslinker, respectively. For example, if the inventive polymer comprises a repeat unit C comprising a photo-crosslinking moiety, the above-described first embodiment of a surface coating reaction is carried out by irradiating the surface comprising the photo-reactive surface crosslinker and the photo-crosslinking moiety comprised in repeat unit C of the inventive polymer with UV light in step d), thereby covalently binding the (protected) inventive polymer to a photo-reactive group of the photo-reactive surface crosslinker, thereby covalently binding the inventive polymer to the surface and crosslinking it to a surface attached network at the same time. Similarly, if the inventive polymer comprises a repeat unit C comprising a thermo-crosslinking moiety, the above-described second embodiment of a surface coating reaction can be carried out by heating the surface comprising the thermo-reactive surface crosslinker and the thermocrosslinking moiety comprised in repeat unit C of the inventive polymer in step d). Further, if the inventive polymer comprises a repeat unit C comprising a photo-crosslinking and/or thermo-crosslinking moiety, respectively, the above-described third embodiment of a surface coating reaction can be carried out without the addition of an external photo-crosslinker and/or thermo-crosslinker, respectively, by adapting step c) accordingly.</p><p>[0262] A monolayer surface coating layer may comprise a thickness of about 2 nm to about 50 nm. A surface-attached network may comprise a thickness of about 10 nm to 10 <math>\mu\text{m}</math>.</p>

<p>[0263] The thickness of the surface coating layer may be dependent on the different methods used for application. Preferably, the thickness of the antimicrobial and/or antifouling (protein-repellent) surface coating layer, comprising the protected or already deprotected inventive polymer, may be about 50 nm to about 500 nm.</p><p>[0264] According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inventive polymer may be surface attached via "grafting onto". In this case, the inventive polymer carries a functional group that can react with the surface carrying a complementary functional group, in a thermally or photochemically activated reaction. For example, if either <math>A_i</math>, <math>B_i</math> or <math>C_i</math> carry a residue containing an alkyl hydroxy group, for example if <math>R^1</math> or <math>R^2</math> of any of the repeat units <math>A_i</math> are an alkyl hydroxy group, or if any <math>B_i</math> is 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, or the like, they may react with a surface cross-linker carrying an active ester, e.g. succinic ester, pentafluorophenol ester, or the like, or acid chloride, anhydride, or the like. Vice versa, if such an activated active ester, e.g. succinic ester, pentafluorophenol ester, or the like, or acid chloride, anhydride, or the like, is present in the inventive polymer, they may react with a complementary OH group on the surface in a "grafting onto" reaction.</p><p>[0265] According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a suitable surface initiator that is able to initiate the radical polymerization from a surface (e.g. the initiator reported in O. Prucker, C. A. Naumann, J. Ruehe, W. Knoll, C. W. Frank, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 8766-8770, or any other known initiator for free or controlled radical polymerization known to the skilled expert) is immobilized on the surface as defined herein. The thus functionalized surface is then immersed into the monomer mixture needed to synthesize the inventive polymer (in an appropriate solvent or in bulk), and the polymerization reaction is initiated thermally or photo-chemically. Thus, the inventive polymer forms as surface-attached "polymer brush" in a "grafting-from" approach.</p><p>[0266] According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a polymer network coating of the polymer of the present invention can be applied to a pretreated surface by a) mixing the respective monomers, i.e. monomers for repeat unit A selected from monomers represented by one of formulae (X-a), (X-b), (X-c), (X-d), (X-e) and/or (X-f), and optionally comonomers for repeat units B and/or C (e.g. monomers represented by formula (XI), etc.), and a thermo-crosslinker, b) coating the surface, and then c) thermo-curing, thereby forming a polymer network on the substrate, optionally including binding to the substrate. Optionally, the active monomers may be applied in their respective protected forms and then de-protected in the polymer network coating the substrate in a subsequent step.</p><p>[0267] According to a second alternative, a coating is obtained using the polymer of the invention comprises repeat units C, which provide the inventive polymer with crosslinking functions, preferably with photo-crosslinking and/or thermally activated crosslinking functions. The inventive polymer comprising repeat units C can be advantageously applied to a surface and covalently attached thereto without the need for extensive and/or complicated preparations of the respective surface. For example, when using the inventive polymer comprising repeat units C, it is not necessary to functionalize with a crosslinking agent the surface prior to coating with the polymer.</p><p>[0268] According to one particular preferred embodiment, a surface as defined herein is preferably coated with an inventive polymer comprising repeat units C comprising a photo-crosslinking moiety according to the following steps:</p><ol type="a"><li>optionally pretreating a surface of a substrate as defined herein to comprise oxide or hydroxide groups;</li><li>coating the optionally pretreated surface with the (protected) inventive polymer as prepared according to the present invention onto the surface as obtained according to optional step a),</li><li>irradiating the photo-reactive crosslinking agent with UV light thereby covalently binding the (protected) inventive polymer to a photo-reactive group of the photo-reactive crosslinking agent, thereby covalently binding the inventive polymer to the surface.</li><li>optionally carrying out a post-irradiation treatment of the covalently bound inventive polymer as obtained by step e) by deprotection as defined herein, e.g. with an acid as defined herein, and/or carrying out washing steps.</li></ol><p>[0269] The steps individual may be carried out as generally defined herein.</p><p>[0270] Preferably, applying the different compounds and/or compositions as defined above to the surface as defined herein and hence coating the surface may occur using any technique known to a skilled person to apply a liquid or semi-liquid compound to a surface, e.g. via a technique, such as immersion, spraying, spray-coating, spin coating or dip coating, pouring, Doctor blading, etc., preferably via spin-coating or dip-coating.</p><p>[0271] In this context, "spin coating" is typically a procedure used to apply uniform thin films to a planar or non-planar surface of a substrate, wherein an excess amount of a solution is usually placed on the surface, which is then rotated at high speed in order to spread the excess fluid by centrifugal force. Machines suitable for the inventive purpose preferably include spin coater or spinner. Typically, four distinct stages may be defined during the spin coating process: 1) Deposition of the coating fluid onto the surface of a substrate, e.g. by using a nozzle, pouring the coating solution or by spraying it onto the surface. A substantial excess of coating solution is usually applied compared to the amount that is required. 2) Acceleration of the substrate up to a final, desired, rotation speed. 3) Spinning of the substrate at a constant rate, wherein fluid viscous forces dominate the fluid thinning behavior. 4) Optionally spinning of the substrate at a constant rate, wherein solvent evaporation dominates the coating thinning behavior. In the continuous process, the steps are</p>

<p>carried out directly after each other.</p><p>[0272] Furthermore, "dip-coating" is typically a procedure used to apply uniform thin films onto flat or cylindrical/round-shaped or otherwise shaped surfaces of substrates and typically can be separated into five stages: 1) Immersion: The substrate is preferably immersed in the solution of the coating material, either without or at a constant speed. 2) Start-up: The substrate preferably remains inside the solution for a while and is started to be pulled up. 3) Deposition: The thin layer is preferably deposited on the substrate while it is pulled up. The withdrawing is optionally carried out by rotating at a preferably constant speed. The speed determines the thickness of the coating. 4) Drainage: Excess liquid usually drains from the surface. 5) Optionally evaporation: The solvent may evaporate from the liquid, forming the thin layer. In the continuous process, the steps are carried out directly after each other.</p><p>[0273] Preferably, the surface as defined above, preferably a pretreated and functionalized surface may be coated as defined above, e.g. with the polymer of the invention via spin coating or dip-coating.</p><p>[0274] Preferably, the polymer of the invention comprising repeat units C may be used to prepare a multi-layer of polymer on the surface of the substrate. The crosslinking moiety present in repeat unit C of the inventive polymer is capable of crosslinking the inventive polymer to a polymer coating already present on the surface of the substrate. The polymer coating already present is a coating of the inventive polymer or another polymer, preferably a coating of the inventive polymer. By this method of coating, a multi-layered crosslinked polymer network coating can be advantageously prepared. The multi-layered crosslinked polymer network coating is associated with the advantageous properties of higher layer thickness and more homogeneous surface coverage.</p><p>[0275] In a preferred method of coating a multi-layered crosslinked polymer network to a substrate, the steps d) and e) of the above method are repeated at least twice, preferably two times to twenty times, more preferably two to five times, and especially preferred about two times.</p><p>[0276] A coating comprising a multi-layered crosslinked polymer network can also be prepared by adding a suitable crosslinking agent as described in the following.</p><p>[0277] Preferably, a (thiol-ene) crosslinked network of the polymers of the invention is preferably formed via a thiol-crosslinker to form covalent bonds between the inventive polymers via their double bonds, as described above ("thiol-ene crosslinking approach"). Such formation of the network structure can also be carried out prior to attaching the polymer network of the inventive polymers to a surface or simultaneously or even subsequently.</p><p>[0278] For any of these variants, the polymers of the invention are preferably mixed with a multifunctional crosslinker, preferably a di-, tri-, tetrafunctional or multifunctional crosslinker, preferably a multifunctional thiol crosslinker, more preferably a di-, tri- or even tetrafunctional thiol crosslinker, which allows crosslinking of the inventive polymers to form a crosslinked network. In this context, the term "multifunctional" preferably refers to the number of thiol-moieties or SH-moieties of such a crosslinker compound, e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or even more thiol-moieties or SH-moieties may be contained in such a multifunctional thiol crosslinker.</p><p>[0279] Crosslinking the inventive polymers with each other preferably occurs via activation of the double bonds present in the repeat units of the polymers, e.g. thermally or via photo-activation as described above, and thereby crosslinking the polymers with each other.

<h2>Examples</h2><h3>General methods.</h3><p>[0291] All oxygen-sensitive reactions were carried out in inert gas atmosphere (e.g. nitrogen). Glassware used for such reactions was heated in <i>vacuo</i>. Solid components were added to reaction flasks under nitrogen flow. Liquid components were de-gassed prior to use with freeze-pump-thaw cycles and added using nitrogen-purged syringes. The polymerization mixtures were subject to three freeze-pump-thaw cycles prior to heating.</p><p>[0292] All chemicals were ACS reagent or p.a. quality, and used as received. All solvents were 99% quality and used as received unless otherwise indicated. Dimethyl acrylamide was filtered over aluminum oxide before use. Dichloromethane, the most commonly used reaction solvent, was freshly distilled from phosphorous pentoxide under nitrogen atmosphere. Aqueous solutions used for workup, for example NaCl and NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, were saturated solutions in equilibrium with solid precipitate.</p><p>[0293] Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) elograms were recorded on a SDV column from PSS (Polymer Standard Services, Mainz, Germany) in Chloroform at 20 to 30°C and a flow rate of 1 mL min<sup>-1</sup>. M<sub>n</sub> of the polymer was determined by calibration with poly(methyl methacrylate) standards form PSS.</p><p>[0294] All NMR spectra were recorded on a 250 MHz Avance Spectrometer (Bruker, Madison, Wisconsin) in deuterated solvents (typically CDCl<sub>3</sub>, DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>, Aceton-d<sub>6</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>O). Coupling constants are stated in Hertz, the chemical shifts <math>\delta</math> are given in ppm. Mass spectra were recorded on a LCQ Advantage or Exactive mass spectrometer by Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA, USA) using electrospray ionization (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). The FTIR spectra were recorded from 4000 to 400 cm<sup>-1</sup> with a Bio-Rad Excalibur spectrometer (Bio-Rad, München, Germany), using a spectrum of the blank double side polished silicon wafer as background. Sample solution (dissolved in dichloromethane or another suitable solvent) were drop coated onto double side polished silicon wafers and measured after the solvent was evaporated. In the analytical data, the symbol ** designates that the peak assignments is interchangeable.</p><h3>Determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC<sub>90</sub>).</h3><p>[0295] The bacterial strain used (<i>Escherichia coli</i> ATCC 25922) had been long-term stored at -80°C in basic growth medium containing 15% (v/v) glycerol. An overnight culture of the bacterial strain was prepared (10<sup>6</sup> colony forming units (CFU) mL<sup>-1</sup> in Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB)). Using a multi-channel pipette, a 96-well microtiter plate was inoculated with the appropriate volumes of bacterial cultures previously prepared in MHB. Stock solutions of the polymers to be tested were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. All polymers were tested in MHB containing residuals of DMSO in a concentration series ranging from 400 <math>\mu</math>g mL<sup>-1</sup> to 6.25 <math>\mu</math>g mL<sup>-1</sup>. The total volume in each well was 150 <math>\mu</math>L. In parallel, a dilution series of DMSO was also tested to exclude possible effects of DMSO residuals. Inoculated wells with MHB which contained neither polymers nor DMSO served as positive control for bacterial growth. Sterile MHB was taken as blank to exclude any contamination. The plates were incubated for 18 h at 37°C in an aerobic atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After incubation, the optical density (OD) at 600 nm was determined using a Tecan Infinite 200 plate-reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). All tests for each strain were carried out at least in duplicate. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of each polymer that was able to inhibit bacterial growth, and is reported with the percentage of bacterial growth at that concentration. The MIC<sub>90</sub> was defined as the concentration at which at least 90% growth reduction was observed.</p><p>[0296] <i>S. aureus</i> was handled analogously, as described in A. Al-Ahmad, D.

The reaction mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. Then, 50 mL DCM was added. This solution was extracted three times with 50 mL K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> solution (10%) and the aqueous phase was washed three times with DCM. The organic layers were dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and the solvent was evaporated at the rotary evaporator. This phase contained the side product, itaconic acid dialkyl ester, which was dried in dynamic vacuum. Concentrated HCl was added to the aqueous phase until the pH was 2. The aqueous phase was then extracted three times with 100 mL DCM and dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The solvent was evaporated at the rotary evaporator and the product was dried in dynamic vacuum overnight. Itaconic acid-4-alkyl ester was received as a colorless solid.
