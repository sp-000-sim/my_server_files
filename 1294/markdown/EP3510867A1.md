Description

[0001] The present invention relates to a new formulation with antimicrobial activity, to a new antimicrobial polymer, to the use of said formulation and said polymer as a biocide e.g. in formulations for cleaning, disinfection and/or descaling purposes, as well as to a cleaning agent or disinfection agent or descaling agent comprising said formulation.

[0002] US-5631274 proposes some imidazolium salts, including di-, tri- and tetramers thereof, as swimming pool sanitizers. WO2012127009 and WO2017025433 describe a number of imidazolium polymers with activity against *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

[0003] It has now been found that a certain class of linear imidazolium polymers of defined molecular weight and limited distribution of chain lengths again shows distinctly improved effects.

[0004] The invention thus primarily pertains to an antimicrobial composition comprising at least one antimicrobial agent and at least one carrier and/or auxiliary agent, wherein an antimicrobial agent is a polymeric, ionic compound containing alkylene linked imidazolium groups.

[0005] While the present polymeric, ionic compound used as antimicrobial agent, as a polymerization product, consists of species of various chain lengths, it typically contains only low amounts of molecular species below 2000 g/mol; typically, species having a molar mass below 2000 g/mol make up less than 12 % of the total weight of the polymeric ionic compound, preferably less than 8 % b.w.

[0006] The polymeric, ionic compound is obtainable by reacting glyoxal, formaldehyde, at least one C4-C8alkylene diamine and at least one protic acid. It is characterized in that its number average molecular weight is from the range 2500 to 19000 g/mol, the fraction of species having a molar mass below 2000 g/mol is less than 12 % of the total weight of the polymeric ionic compound, and its polydispersity is from the range 2 to 9.

[0007] Polydispersity is the ratio  $M_w/M_n$  between the weight average molecular weight ( $M_w$ ) and the number average of the molecular weight  $M_n$ . Preferred polymers typically show a polydispersity from the range 2.5 to 8.5. The number average molecular weight of preferred polymers is typically from the range 3000 to 19000, more preferably 4000 to 17000, especially 5000 to 10000 g/mol. In an especially preferred embodiment, the present polymeric, ionic compound further shows a weight average molecular weight ( $M_w$ ) from the range 20000 to 80000, such as 25000 to 70000, or even 30000 to 60000 g/mol.

[0008] Molecular weight  $M_w$ ,  $M_n$  and polydispersity are as determined by gel permeation chromatography, especially using modified polyacrylate-copolymer gel, poly(2-vinylpyridine) standards, and water containing 0.1% (w/w) trifluoroacetic acid and 0.1 mol of sodium chloride per liter as eluent at 35°C (see chromatographic method described further below).

[0009] The C4-C8alkylene diamine preferably is hexylene diamine; the reaction mixture for obtaining the polymeric, ionic compound generally does not contain any monoamine.

[0010] Typically, the polymeric, ionic compound in the present composition comprises repeating units of the formula

![Chemical structure of a repeating unit of the polymeric ionic compound: an imidazolium ring linked to a polymer backbone via a nitrogen atom, with a substituent R attached to the other nitrogen atom.]()

whose positive charges are counterbalanced by anions  $Ac^-$ , and preferably a polymer of the formula I

![Chemical structure of the repeating unit of the polymeric ionic compound (Formula I): a polymer chain consisting of repeating imidazolium units linked by R, with counterions Ac^- attached to the imidazolium nitrogen atoms. The chain is terminated by E and E' groups.]()

(I),

wherein

E is C4-C8 aminoalkyl or C4-C8 ammoniumalkyl, wherein preferably the alkyl is straight chain alkyl carrying a terminal amino or ammonium group;

E' is as defined for E, or is hydrogen; E' typically has the same meaning as E;

R is C4-C8alkylene, preferably of straight chain;

$Ac^-$  is the anion of the protonic acid used in the preparation method outlined above, such as an anion selected from  $HCOO$ ,  $CH_3COO$ ,  $C_3$ - $C_{19}$  alkylcarboxylate,  $HSO_4^-$ , sulphate, nitrate,  $H_2PO_4^-$ ,  $HPO_4^{2-}$ ,  $PO_4^{3-}$ ,  $C_1$ - $C_8$  sulfonate, trifluoromethane-

2------------------------------------------------

thyl-sulfonate, or halogenides such as chloride, bromide iodide; especially acetate; and n denotes the number of repeating units to obtain a number average molecular weight from the range 2500 to 19000 g/mol. Thus, the present polymeric, ionic compound commonly contains typical molecular species wherein n ranges from 10 to 75, preferably from 15 to 60.

[0011] A preferred composition of the invention comprises a polymeric ionic compound, typically of the formula I, whose end groups, or E in formula I, is aminoethyl or ammoniumethyl, and R is hexylene. Preferably, Ac- stands for the acetyl anion.

[0012] Thus, a preferred embodiment of the invention is an antimicrobial composition comprising, as an antimicrobial agent, at least one linear polymeric, ionic compound comprising imidazolium groups, and at least one carrier and/or at least one auxiliary agent, wherein the polymeric compound has a number average molecular weight from the range 3000 to 19000 g/mol and a polydispersity from the range 2 to 9, as described above, and preferably conforms to the above formula I such as exemplified by present polymers A, B, C and D, especially where a liquid carrier and at least one auxiliary from the groups (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) described below is present.

[0013] Another preferred embodiment of the invention is an antimicrobial composition comprising, as an antimicrobial agent, at least one linear polymeric, ionic compound comprising imidazolium groups, and at least one carrier and/or at least one auxiliary agent, wherein the polymeric compound has a number average molecular weight from the range 4000 to 17000 g/mol and a polydispersity from the range 2 to 9, as described above, and preferably conforms to the above formula I such as exemplified by present polymers B, C and D, especially where a liquid carrier and at least one auxiliary from the groups (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) described below is present.

[0014] Another preferred embodiment of the invention is an antimicrobial composition comprising, as an antimicrobial agent, at least one linear polymeric, ionic compound comprising imidazolium groups, and at least one carrier and/or at least one auxiliary agent, wherein the polymeric compound has a number average molecular weight from the range 5000 to 17000 and a polydispersity from the range 2 to 9, as described above, and preferably conforms to the above formula I such as exemplified by present polymers C and D, especially where a liquid carrier and at least one auxiliary from the groups (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) described below is present.

[0017] The composition of the present invention provides high antimicrobial activity, especially when applied in form of a formulation for cleaning, disinfection and/or descaling. The composition of the present invention further provides advantageous properties in the formulation, and in the application of biocidal formulations, such as reduced foam generation, better compatibility with auxiliary agents such as surfactants, stability of the liquid formulation, and good dosability. Advantageous carriers and/or auxiliary agents, especially for these purposes, are as noted below. The composition of the present invention further has the advantage of safer application with respect to toxic effects like undesired skin sensitization, which may be avoided when using the present composition.

## Preparation

[0018] Present linear imidazolium polymer is advantageously prepared in analogy to methods described in WO 2016/020214, WO 2012/127009, WO 2010/072571, and literature cited therein, by reaction of glyoxal (i.e. ethane-1,2-dione), formaldehyde and alkylene diamine in presence of a protic acid and a solvent. Typically, educts are used in about equimolar amounts, and the protic acid is used in an amount about equal with the moles of amine moieties in the reaction mixture.

[0019] The term "about" in the context of the present invention denotes an interval of accuracy that the person skilled in the art will understand to still ensure the technical effect of the feature in question. The term typically indicates deviation from the indicated numerical value of  $\pm 20\%$ , preferably  $\pm 15\%$ , more preferably  $\pm 10\%$ , and even more preferably  $\pm 5\%$ , except in case of temperatures, where the term "about" denotes a possible deviation by plus or minus 5 degrees (preferably up to plus or minus 2.5 degrees). The term "essentially" is synonymous to "about" and denotes a possible deviation from the basic value as noted above.

3------------------------------------------------

[0020] The protic acid in the reaction mixture for obtaining the polymeric, ionic compound is preferably selected from C1-C20 carboxylic acids and mineralic acids such as formic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, acetic acid, aliphatic carboxylic acids having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, C1-C8 sulfonic acids, trifluoromethyl-sulfonic acid; especially preferred is acetic acid.

[0021] Methods for obtaining the present linear imidazolium polymer will be described below in more detail.

[0022] The reaction of present educts glyoxal, formaldehyde and alkylene diamine is carried out simultaneously. The reaction may be carried out by mixing the reactands, e.g. by adding the reactands to the protic acid, in the presence of a suitable solvent. Typically, a polar solvent (different from a protic acid) is used such as water or mixtures of water with other protic solvents such as an alcohol. Some protic acids such as carboxylic acid may also be used as additional solvent by using an excess of such acid. Typically, protic acid or its solution may be furnished in a suitable reaction vessel, advantageously with stirring, and solutions of the aldehydes and the diamine are simultaneously added while controlling the temperature of the mixture. Advantageously, the alkylene diamine and the aldehyde solution containing glyoxal and formaldehyde are added to the protic acid separately, e.g. using separate feeds. In a preferred process, the molar ratio of each of the aldehydes to the diamine in the reaction mixture is not lower than 1 during each time period of the addition step, the ratio preferably being from the range 1 to 1.2, especially 1 to 1.05. Temperature of the mixture is preferably controlled during this step to remain in the lower liquid range, such as -20°C to about 40°C, or 0 to 30°C. Pressure is only of minor importance, e.g. to ensure a certain liquid range such as about -5° to about 100°C in case of atmospheric pressure and use of water as the solvent. After addition of all components, the reaction mixture advantageously is heated e.g. to about 60 to 150°C, or up to the boiling point, for a time period of about 0.1 to 10 hours. A convenient method uses a temperature from about 0°C to about 100°C throughout the reaction. In another preferred reaction, temperature of the mixture is kept between about 0°C and about 50°C with cooling, typically between about 15 and 30°C, during the addition step; subsequently, temperature may be raised to a temperature between about 50°C to the boiling point of the solvent or solvent mixture at normal pressure, e.g. to about 80 to 105°C. Depending on the amounts of educts used and the cooling conditions, the addition of educts may be completed within a time period ranging from about 5 minutes up to many hours, e.g. 0.5 to about 10 hours. Similarly, the optional subsequent heating step may last from about 5 minutes up to many hours, e.g. 15 minutes to about 5 hours.

[0023] After completion of the reaction, the mixture comprising the polymer of the invention typically has a pH from the acidic range, e.g. 3-7, especially 5-6 in case that acetic acid is used as the protic acid. The mixture may be used as such, or may be subjected to further derivatization (e.g. reacting with alkylating agent) and/or purification steps (e.g. filtration as described below, removal of the solvent under reduced pressure and/or heating to the boiling point).

[0024] Present linear imidazolium polymer is prepared in the presence of a suitable solvent, typically a polar solvent compatible with the educts and end product. Preferred solvents are water, alcohols like C1-C4 alcohols, esters, amides, and mixtures of such solvents, especially water and C1-C4 alcohols. Typically, the educts formaldehyde and glyoxal are added to the reaction mixture as a solution in such solvent.

[0025] Obtaining the desired molecular weight and distribution of chain lengths may be facilitated by an additional step of ultrafiltration or dialysis. Thus, the crude product obtained from the polymerization reaction may be subjected to ultrafiltration, e.g. by filling the diluted solution of the product into a filtration cell fitted with suitable membrane with cut-off e.g. between 5 and 15 kD molecular weight, and pressurizing the cell.

[0026] The imidazolium polymer thus obtained may be subjected to an anion exchange. This allows the preparation of imidazolium polymers even with anions for which no corresponding stable protic acid exists. The anion exchange can be effected by known methods, e.g. transprotonation, reaction with a metal salt, ion exchange chromatography, electrolytically or by means of a combination of these measures. Anions of the present polymer (expressed as Ac<sup>-</sup> in the below formula I) thus may comprise any convenient anion, such as halide, sulfate, hydrogensulfate, alkylsulfate, arylsulfate, perfluoro alkyl- and arylsulfates, sulfonate, alkylsulfonate, arylsulfonate, perfluoro alkyl- and arylsulfonates, phosphate, halophosphate, alkylphosphate, nitrate, perchlorate, tetrachloroaluminate, tetrafluoroborate, alkylborate, saccharinate, alkyl carboxylates or bis(perfluoroalkylsulfonyl)anions. Anions also comprise halogenides and pseudo-halogenides such as F<sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup>, CN<sup>-</sup>, SCN<sup>-</sup>, OCN<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, N(CN)<sup>-</sup>, or BF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, PF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup>, AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, AlCl<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, AlBr<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, ZnCl<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SnCl<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, CuCl<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>; the group of sulfates, sulfites and sulfonates, the group of phosphates; the group of phosphonates and phosphinates; the group of phosphites; the group of phosphonites and phosphinites; the group of carboxylates and polybasic carboxylic acids; the group of boronates; the group of silicates and silicic esters; the group of alkylsilane and arylsilane salts; the group of carboximides, bis(sulfonyl)imides and sulfonylimides.

[0027] The molecular weight of the antimicrobial polymer of the invention thus obtained typically is from a range as noted further above. Preferred is an antimicrobial polymer of the invention showing a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) from the range 2.5 to 8.5. The invention thus includes products comprising varying chain length, such as polymeric ionic compounds obtainable as described above and characterized by a molecular weight as noted hereinabove and showing a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) from the range noted above. The present composition thus comprises more than one individual linear polyimidazolium compound; typically, the present composition thus comprises a mixture of polymeric compounds each of which falling under formula I.

Such agents are typically selected from aldehydes, alcohols and chlorinated hydroxydiphenylethers, examples such as glutaraldehyde, glyoxal, phenoxyethanol, triclosan (the compound 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenylether), and diclosan (i.e. the compound 4,4'-dichloro-2-hydroxydiphenylether) are commercially available from BASF SE under the trade names Protectol GA, Protectol GL, Protectol PE, Tinosan HP 100.

[0045] A preferred embodiment of the invention thus is an antimicrobial composition comprising, as an antimicrobial agent, at least one linear polymeric, ionic compound comprising imidazolium groups, and at least one carrier and/or at least one auxiliary agent, wherein the polymeric compound has a molecular weight and polydispersity as defined further above, is obtainable by a method as described above, and preferably conforms to the above formula I, wherein the auxiliary agent is selected from

Also of special technical importance is such composition comprising the liquid carrier and a surfactant (especially from the above group (i)) and a further component of group (iii). Also of special technical importance is such composition comprising the liquid carrier and a surfactant (especially from the above group (i)) and a further component of group (iv).

[0047] The composition of the invention contains the polymeric, ionic compound comprising imidazolium groups generally in an amount ranging from 0.0001 to 30 % by weight of the composition; specific dosages for typical applications are given further below. Liquid concentrates (typically aqueous and/or alcoholic, e.g. using a polyhydric alcohol such as propylene glycol as the solvent) may be formulated, which contain up to 70% by weight of the present imidazolium polymer, typically 10 to 70%; an example is an aqueous solution containing about 50% by weight of the polymer. The auxiliary agent, too, is often present in an amount ranging from 0.0001 to 30 % by weight of the composition. In case that the present composition comprises a surfactant as the auxiliary (or one of the auxiliaries), this may be the main component; in case of a solid composition (e.g. a powder composition), the surfactant may make up e.g. 10 to 95% by weight of the composition. In case that the present composition is a liquid composition, a liquid carrier is typically present as a main component, making up e.g. 30 to 99.9999 % b.w. of the total composition, or, if an auxiliary is present, e.g. 30 to 98 % b.w. of the composition. The amounts of the present polymeric, ionic compound comprising imidazolium groups, of the carrier and of the auxiliary generally add up to 100 % of the composition.

[0048] The formulation of the invention may comprise the polymeric imidazolium compound of the invention in the mixture as obtained, e.g. of pH from the range 5 to 6, or in a pH adjusted way (typically after addition of a suitable base such as NaOH or KOH, or after addition of a suitable acid such as acetic acid or methanesulfonic acid in case that a low pH is desired). Typical is an aqueous formulation of a pH from the neutral to acidic range, e.g. from the range of pH 3 to 7, e.g. 5 to 6, or an aqueous formulation, which has a pH from the range of 7 to 10; the aqueous formulation contains at least 50 wt.-%, especially 80 to 99.8 wt.-%, of water.

[0049] Suitable adjuvants are compounds which have a neglectable or even no bioicial activity themselves, and which improve the biological performance of the polymeric, ionic compound comprising imidazolium groups on the target. Examples are surfactants, mineral or vegetable oils, and other auxiliaries. Further examples are listed by Knowles,

[0050] Adjuvants and additives, Agrow Reports DS256, T&F Informa UK, 2006, chapter 5.

[0051] Further suitable thickeners are polysaccharides (e.g. xanthan gum, carboxymethylcellulose), anorganic clays (organically modified or unmodified), polycarboxylates, and silicates. Further suitable bactericides and antimicrobial agents, such as bronopol and isothiazolinone derivatives, are as listed below.

[0052] Suitable anti-freezing agents are ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, urea and glycerin. Suitable anti-foaming agents are silicones, long chain alcohols, and salts of fatty acids. Suitable colorants (e.g. in red, blue, or green) are pigments of low water solubility and water-soluble dyes. Examples are inorganic colorants (e.g. iron oxide, titan oxide,

7------------------------------------------------

iron hexacyanoferrate) and organic colorants (e.g. alizarin-, azo- and phthalocyanine colorants).

[0053] Further suitable tackifiers or binders are polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyvinylacetates, polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylates, biological or synthetic waxes, and cellulose ethers

[0054] Suitable surfactants such as cationic, amphoteric, non-ionic and anionic surfactants are widely known in the art.

[0055] Suitable cationic surfactants include quaternary surfactants, for example quaternary ammonium compounds with one or two hydrophobic groups, or salts of long-chain primary amines. Examples of suitable cationic surfactants are quaternized ethoxylated fatty amines, quaternized ethoxylated fatty oils and blends thereof and with further surfactants such as Dehyquart CSP, Demelan AU-39/Bio (commercially available from BASF SE). Preference is given to ammonium halides, such as alkyltrimethylammonium chlorides, dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides and trialkylmethylammonium chlorides, for example cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, stearyltrimethylammonium chloride, distearyldimethylammonium chloride, lauryldimethylammonium chloride, lauryldimethylbenzylammonium chloride and tricetyltrimethylammonium chloride. Further cationic surfactants that can be used in accordance with the invention are quaternised protein hydrolysates.

Also suitable in accordance with the invention are cationic silicone oils, such as, for example, the commercially available products Q2-7224 (manufacturer: Dow Corning; a stabilised trimethylsilylamodimethicone), Dow Corning 929 emulsion (comprising a hydroxylamino-modified silicone, which is also referred to as amodimethicone), SM-2059 (manufacturer: General Electric), SLM-55067 (manufacturer: Wacker) and also Abil®-Quat 3270 and 3272 (manufacturer: Th. Goldschmidt; diquaternary polydimethylsiloxanes, quaternium-80), or silicones, as described in WO 00/12057, especially page 45, line 9 to page 55, line 2.

Alkylamidoamines, especially fatty acid amidoamines, such as the stearylamidopropyltrimethylamine obtainable under the name Tego Amid® 18, are distinguished not only by a good conditioning action but also especially by their good biodegradability. Quaternary ester compounds, so-called "esterquats", such as the methyl hydroxyalkyldialkoyloxyalkylammonium methosulfates marketed under the trademark Stepantex®, are also very readily biodegradable.

[0056] An example of a quaternary sugar derivative that can be used as cationic surfactant is the commercial product Glucquat®100, according to CTFA nomenclature a "lauryl methyl gluceth-10 hydroxypropyl dimonium chloride".

[0057] A wide variety of anionic surfactants are potentially useful herein. Several examples of suitable anionic surfactants are disclosed in US Pat 3,929,678, which is incorporated herein by reference.

[0058] Although anionic surfactants are not preferred for formulations with cationic biocides such as the present polymeric ionic compound, formulations of the invention may contain anionic surfactants, e.g. in order to adjust certain properties of the formulation. Examples of anionic surfactants include those selected from the group consisting of alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates, sulfated monoglycerides, sulfonated olefins, alkyl aryl sulfonates, primary or secondary alkane sulfonates, alkyl sulfosuccinates, acyl taurates, acyl isethionates, alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonate, sulfonated methyl esters, sulfonated fatty acids, alkyl phosphates, acyl glutamates, acyl sarcosinates, alkyl sulfoacetates, acylated peptides, alkyl ether carboxylates, acyl lactylates, anionic fluorosurfactants, and mixtures thereof. Mixtures of anionic surfactants can be used effectively in the present invention.

[0059] Alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates have the respective formulae  $R_1-O-SO_3-M$  and  $R_1-(CH_2H_4-O)_x-O-SO_3-M$ , wherein  $R_1$  is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl group from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, x is 1 to 10, and M is a water-soluble cation such as ammonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, triethanolamine, diethanolamine and monoethanolamine. The alkyl sulfates are typically made by the sulfation of monohydric alcohols (having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms) using sulfur trioxide or other known sulfation technique. The alkyl ether sulfates are typically made as condensation products of ethylene oxide and monohydric alcohols (having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms) and then sulfated. These alcohols can be derived from fats, e.g., coconut oil or tallow, or can be synthetic. Common examples of alkyl sulfates include sodium, ammonium, potassium, magnesium, or TEA salts of lauryl or myristyl sulfate. Common examples alkyl ether sulfates include ammonium, sodium, magnesium, or TEA laureth-3 sulfate.

[0060] Another class of anionic surfactants potentially useful are sulfated monoglycerides of the formula  $R_1-CO-O-CH_2-C(OH)H-CH_2-O-SO_3-M$ , wherein  $R_1$  is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl group from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, and M is a water-soluble cation such as ammonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, triethanolamine, diethanolamine and monoethanolamine. These are typically made by the reaction of glycerin with fatty acids (having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms) to form a monoglyceride and the subsequent sulfation of this monoglyceride with sulfur trioxide. An example of a sulfated monoglyceride is sodium cocomonoglyceride sulfate.

[0061] Other anionic surfactants potentially useful include olefin sulfonates of the form  $R_1SO_3-M$ , wherein  $R_1$  is a mono-olefin having from about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms, and M is a water-soluble cation such as ammonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, triethanolamine, diethanolamine and monoethanolamine. These compounds can be produced by the sulfonation of D-olefins by means of uncomplexed sulfur trioxide, followed by neutralization of the acid reaction mixture in conditions such that any sultones which have been formed in the reaction are hydrolyzed to give the corresponding hydroxyalkanesulfonate. An example of a sulfonated olefin is sodium  $C_{14}/C_{16}$  D-olefin sulfonate.

[0062] Other anionic surfactants potentially useful are the linear alkylbenzene sulfonates of the form  $R_1-C_6H_4-SO_3-M$ , wherein  $R_1$  is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl group from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms,

8------------------------------------------------

and M is a water-soluble cation such as ammonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, triethanolamine, diethanolamine and monoethanolamine. These are formed by the sulfonation of linear alkyl benzene with sulfur trioxide. An example of this anionic surfactant is sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate.

[0063] Still other anionic surfactants include the primary or secondary alkane sulfonates of the form  $R_1-SO_3^-M$ , wherein  $R_1$  is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl chain from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, and M is a water-soluble cation such as ammonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, triethanolamine, diethanolamine and monoethanolamine. These are commonly formed by the sulfonation of paraffins using sulfur dioxide in the presence of chlorine and ultraviolet light or another known sulfonation method. The sulfonation can occur in either the secondary or primary positions of the alkyl chain. An example of an alkane sulfonate useful herein is alkali metal or ammonium C13-C17 paraffin sulfonates.

[0064] Still other anionic surfactants potentially useful are the alkyl sulfosuccinates, which include disodium N-octadecylsulfosuccinamate; diammonium lauryl sulfosuccinate; tetrasodium N-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl)-N-octadecylsulfosuccinate; diamyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid; dihexyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid; and dioctyl esters of sodium sulfosuccinic acid.

[0065] Also useful may be taurates which are based on taurine, also known as 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. Examples of taurates include N-alkyltaurines such as the one prepared by reacting dodecylamine with sodium isethionate according to the teaching of US Pat 2,658,072 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other examples based of taurine include the acyl taurines formed by the reaction of n-methyl taurine with fatty acids (having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms).

[0066] Another class of anionic surfactants potentially useful are the acyl isethionates. The acyl isethionates typically have the formula  $R_1-CO-O-CH_2-CH_2SO_3^-M$ , wherein  $R_1$  is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl group having from about 10 to about 30 carbon atoms, and M is a cation. These are typically formed by the reaction of fatty acids (having from about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms) with an alkali metal isethionate. Non-limiting examples of these acyl isethionates include ammonium cocoyl isethionate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium lauroyl isethionate, and mixtures thereof.

[0067] Still other anionic surfactants potentially useful are the alkylglyceryl ether sulfonates of the form  $R_1-OCH_2-C(OH)H-CH_2-SO_3^-M$ , wherein  $R_1$  is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl group from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, and M is a water-soluble cation such as ammonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, triethanolamine, diethanolamine and monoethanolamine. These can be formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin and sodium bisulfite with fatty alcohols (having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms) or other known methods. One example is sodium cocoglyceryl ether sulfonate.

[0068] Other anionic surfactants potentially useful include the sulfonated fatty acids of the form  $R_1-CH(SO_4)-COOH$  and sulfonated methyl esters of the form  $R_1-CH(SO_4)-CO-O-CH_3$ , where  $R_1$  is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl group from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms. These can be formed by the sulfonation of fatty acids or alkyl methyl esters (having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms) with sulphur trioxide or by another known sulfonation technique. Examples include alpha sulphonated coconut fatty acid and lauryl methyl ester.

[0069] Other anionic materials potentially useful as surfactants include alkyl ether carboxylates corresponding to the formula  $R_1-(OCH_2CH_2)_x-OCH_2-CO_2^-M$  wherein  $R_1$  is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group of about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, x is 1 to 10, and M is a water-soluble cation. Nonlimiting examples of which include sodium laureth carboxylate.

[0070] Other anionic materials potentially useful as surfactants include acyl lactylates corresponding to the formula  $R_1-CO-[O-CH(CH_3)-CO]_x-CO_2^-M$  wherein  $R_1$  is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group of about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, x is 3, and M is a water-soluble cation, non-limiting examples of which include sodium cocoyl lactylate.

[0071] Other anionic materials potentially useful as surfactants include the carboxylates, non-limiting examples of which include sodium lauroyl carboxylate, sodium cocoyl carboxylate, and ammonium lauroyl carboxylate. Anionic fluoro-surfactants can also be used.

Nonlimiting examples of which include sodium lauroyl glutamate and sodium cocoyl glutamate.

[0073] Other anionic materials include alkanoyl sarcosinates corresponding to the formula  $R_1-CON(CH_3)-CH_2CH_2-CO_2^-M$  wherein  $R_1$  is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched alkyl or alkenyl group of about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms, and M is a water-soluble cation. Nonlimiting examples of which include sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate, and ammonium lauroyl sarcosinate.

[0074] Any counter cation, M, can be used on the anionic surfactant. Typically the counter cation is selected from the group consisting of sodium, potassium, ammonium, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine.

[0075] The formulation of the invention typically contains a surfactant, such as a cationic, an anionic, amphoteric or

9------------------------------------------------

preferably a non-ionic surfactant; mixtures of cationic, anionic, amphoteric and/or non-ionic surfactants such as mixtures of anionic and non-ionic surfactants, or mixtures of cationic and non-ionic surfactants may also be used.

[0076] The imidazolium polymers used in accordance with the invention, as well as formulations of the invention containing such polymers, exhibit pronounced antimicrobial action, for example against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma, yeasts and molds and viruses (including enveloped and non-enveloped viruses). They are effective against fungi and bacteria and, most importantly, they retain their effectiveness against fungi and bacteria even when in combination with non-ionic surfactants. They further show pronounced anti-biofilm activity, preventing or inhibiting the formation of a bio-film, with disruption, kill and/or removal of an existing biofilm, which allows for the preparation of efficient formulations for clean-in-place (CIP), water treatment or sanitary disinfection, as described further below.

#### Application of the present composition

[0130] Antimicrobial formulations of the invention are also applied in clean-in-place (CIP) applications. CIP applications are used in practice in the food and beverage industry, like in breweries, in the dairy industry, in the soft-drink and juice manufacturing industry, but also in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry.

[0131] As noted, the invention includes a product selected from the group consisting of home care formulation, a disinfectant of hard and/or soft surfaces, sanitary detergent of hard and/or soft surfaces, and product for clean in place (CIP), wherein said article comprises, preferably comprises at least 70 wt.-% of, still more preferably comprises at least 90 wt.-% of, yet more preferably consists of, the formulation as described herein. Accordingly the present invention is especially directed to a product selected from the group consisting of disinfectant, all purpose cleaner, dishwashing liquid, descaling agent, bath room cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, floor cleaner, glass cleaner, kitchen cleaner, sanitary cleaner, furniture cleaner and product for clean in place (CIP), wherein said product comprises, preferably comprises at least 70 wt.-% of, still more preferably comprises at least 90 wt.-% of, yet more preferably consists of, the formulation as described herein.

[0132] Like the formulation also the products containing the formulation of the present invention can be used as concentrate that has to be diluted with water prior to use or are ready-to-use products, which are used as such, e.g. without dilution.

[0133] The terms used in the previous paragraphs are understood according to the knowledge of the skilled artisan in the respective technical field. For instance, a disinfectant is a substance that is applied to non-living (i.e. inanimate) objects to destroy microorganisms that are living on said objects. On the other hand, the clean in place is a method of cleaning and/or disinfecting the interior surfaces of pipes, vessels, process equipment, filters and associated fittings without disassembly. The clean in place product according to this invention is especially used for removing soils and

19------------------------------------------------

disinfection in facilities for processing typically liquid product streams such as beverages, milk, juices, etc. The formulation of the invention can be used for disinfection of the interior surfaces in CIP after a separate cleaning step. The cleaning step is performed with a cleaning formulation that is not biocidal or disinfecting. It may however also be the case that the formulation of the invention is used for CIP-cleaning and CIP disinfection in one single step.

[0134] Depending on the end application the formulation may contain further ingredients making it ready for the desired end-use. Such ingredients are known to the skilled artisan and do not contribute to the present invention. Depending upon the form of the formulation used at the end it comprises, in addition to the components mentioned above further constituents, for example surfactants (surface active agents), pH regulators, buffering agents, hydrotropes, polymers, metal sequestering or metal chelating agents, colourings, perfume oils, thickening or solidifying agents (consistency regulators), emulsifiers, emollients, UV-absorbers, and antioxidants.

[0135] Within the context of the invention, cleaning compositions or cleaners for inanimate materials are:

- compositions for cleaning and/or disinfecting hard surfaces, such as all-purpose cleaners, floor cleaners, dishwashing detergents for manual or automatic dishwashing, glass cleaners, kitchen cleaners, bath and sanitary cleaners, WC cleaners, disinfectant cleaners,
- cleaning and care compositions for textiles and laundry such as detergents, fabric softeners, stain removers.

[0136] Within the context of the invention, cleaning compositions or cleaners for use in an antimicrobial treatment of the human or animal body, especially of the skin, oral cavity, hair and mucous membranes, are:

- antimicrobial hand washes or hand disinfectants, which are typically rinsed with water after application,
- antimicrobial or disinfecting hand rubs, which are typically leave-on products not rinsed off after application,
- antimicrobial or disinfecting products for skin, oral cavity, hair and mucous membranes for human beings or animals.

[0137] Formulation types of the cleaners are selected from the group comprising: cleaner and disinfectant concentrate, liquid cleaners or disinfectants, pulverulent cleaners or disinfectants, sprays for cleaning or disinfection, emulsions and gels.

[0138] The inanimate surfaces to be treated are selected from the group comprising: glass, plastics, metal, steel, wood, stone materials, ceramic, cement, coatings, composite materials, textiles (natural fibers such as e.g. cotton, wool, silk and synthetic fibers such as polyester, polyolefins (PE, PP etc.), polyamide, polyurethane, PVC etc.), foam materials and upholstery materials and carpets.

[0139] In one variant of the present invention, it is a cleaning composition for hard surfaces. Within the context of the invention, hard surfaces include e.g. tiles, ceramic, glass, glass fibers, metals, steel, aluminum, plastic, wood, stone materials, coatings, composite materials, cement and the like, but do not include textiles.

[0140] During the cleaning of hard surfaces, it is often necessary to disinfect a surface. In this application, disinfection is understood as meaning the killing of microorganisms or the reduction in the growth of microorganisms. The treatment of the surfaces can be done in a two-step process with cleaning the surface first, and afterwards disinfecting the cleaned surface, using two different products for cleaning and disinfecting whereby between cleaning and disinfection a rinsing step may optionally be performed. Or the cleaning and disinfection is done in one step with a formulation providing cleaning and disinfecting properties. In both cases, after the disinfection, it may be necessary to rinse the disinfected surface, e.g. with water, to remove unwanted residuals. In other cases, the surface is not rinsed after the disinfection step in order to achieve a long-term antimicrobial activity on the treated surfaces by residual amounts of the imidazolium compound defined above.

[0141] The present polyimidazolium compounds may also be used as preservatives for material protection. These preservatives are preferably used in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical formulations.

[0142] Furthermore, the polymers of the invention can also be used for control of microorganisms in technical applications as in-can preservative for household products and technical products.

[0143] Typical in-can preservative applications of present imidazolium polymers are technical products such as paints and coatings, aqueous emulsions, latexes, adhesives, inks, synthetic glues, protein-based glues, pigment dispersions, mineral slurries, caulks and adhesives, tape joint compounds, disinfectants, cleaners, textile fluids, and systems used therewith.

[0144] In addition to the preservation of cosmetics, personal care, household and technical products, the present imidazolium polymer may be used for controlling microorganisms in industrial and water containing systems and processes such as cooling towers, heat exchangers, boiler systems, other industrial process water, ballast water, wastewater treatment systems, reverse osmosis water processing, and in swimming pools, spa facilities, pulp and paper manufacture, metal working fluids, leather manufacture.

[0145] The biocides of the invention are useful for controlling microorganisms in aqueous or water-containing systems, such as those present in oil and natural gas applications. Examples of such systems include, but are not limited to,

20------------------------------------------------

injection and produced water, source water for waterflooding and hydraulic fracturing such as pond water and holding tank water, functional fluids such as drilling muds, workover fluids, hydrotest fluids, packer fluids, oil and gas pipelines or fuel.

[0146] In addition, the present biocides may be employed in other areas. The biocides of the invention are suitable for use over a wide temperature range. In a preferred embodiment, the biocides are used in aqueous or water-containing systems at a temperature of 20° C or higher (e.g. within the temperature range 20-90°C). In further embodiments, the temperature of the aqueous or water containing system is 60° C or higher, or is 80° C or higher. The present biocides are also effective in combination with a reducing agent, such as a source of sulfide ions present in the aqueous or water-containing system.

[0147] In contrast to an disinfection agent, which destroys the microorganism very fast, a preservative provides an effect over a longer period of time. Preservatives thus show a microbiostatic effect.

[0148] The concentration of the preservative according to the present invention in a formulation can vary. Generally, the preservatives of the present invention can be incorporated in a commercial formulation at a concentration of between about 0.01 and about 5 weight percentage (wt-%), based on total formulation. More specifically, for cosmetic or pharmaceutical formulations, the amount of the present mixture need not exceed 1.0 wt-%; however, for industrial or household cleaners, up to 5 wt-% can be employed when desired.

[0149] An embodiment of the present invention is a personal care formulation comprising 0.01 to 5 wt-% of at least one polyimidazolium compound, such as a compound of formula (I), and 95 to 99.99 wt-% of at least one cosmetically tolerable adjuvant.

[0150] Another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising 0.01 to 5 wt-% of at least one polyimidazolium compound, e.g. of formula (I), and 95 to 99.99 wt-% of at least one pharmaceutically tolerable adjuvant.

[0151] Another embodiment of the present invention is a household formulation comprising at least one polyimidazolium compound, e.g. of formula (I), and adjuvants used in household formulations.

[0152] A soap has, for example, the following composition:

<table><tr><td>0.01 to 5 wt-%</td><td>of at least one compound of formula (I),</td></tr><tr><td>0.3 to 1 wt-%</td><td>of titanium dioxide,</td></tr><tr><td>1 to 10 wt-%</td><td>of stearic acid,</td></tr><tr><td>0 to 10 wt-%</td><td>of at least one auxiliary, and</td></tr><tr><td>ad 100 %</td><td>of a soap base, e.g. the sodium salts of tallow fatty acid and coconut fatty acid or glycerol.</td></tr></table>

[0153] A shampoo has, for example, the following composition:

<table><tr><td>0.01 to 5 wt-%</td><td>of at least one compound of formula (I),</td></tr><tr><td>12.0 wt-%</td><td>of sodium laureth-2-sulfate,</td></tr><tr><td>4.0 wt-%</td><td>of cocamidopropyl betaine,</td></tr><tr><td>3.0 wt-%</td><td>of NaCl,</td></tr><tr><td>0 to 10 wt-%</td><td>of at least one auxiliary, and</td></tr><tr><td>ad 100 wt-%</td><td>of water.</td></tr></table>

[0154] A deodorant has, for example, the following composition:

<table><tr><td>0.01 to 5 wt-%</td><td>of at least one compound of formula (I),</td></tr><tr><td>60 wt-%</td><td>of ethanol,</td></tr><tr><td>0.3 wt-%</td><td>of perfume oil,</td></tr><tr><td>0 to 10 wt-%</td><td>of at least one auxiliary, and</td></tr><tr><td>ad 100 wt-%</td><td>of water.</td></tr></table>

[0155] All wt-%'s are based on the total weight of the compositions.

[0156] The invention relates also to an oral composition, comprising from 0.01 to 15 wt-%, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one compound of formula (I), and orally tolerable adjuvants.

21------------------------------------------------

Example of an oral composition:

[0157]

<table><tr><td>5</td><td>10 wt-%</td><td>of sorbitol</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>10 wt-%</td><td>of glycerol</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15 wt-%</td><td>of ethanol</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>15 wt-%</td><td>of propylene glycol</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>0.5 wt-%</td><td>of sodium lauryl sulfate</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.25 wt-%</td><td>of sodium methylcocol taurate</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.25 wt-%</td><td>of polyoxypropylene/polyoxyethylene block copolymer</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.10 wt-%</td><td>of peppermint flavouring</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>0.1 to 0.5 wt-%</td><td>of at least one compound of formula (I), and</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>48.6 wt-%</td><td>of water.</td></tr></table>

[0158] The oral composition according to the invention may be, for example, in the form of a gel, a paste, a cream or an aqueous preparation (mouthwash).

[0159] The oral composition according to the invention may also comprise compounds that release fluoride ions which are effective against the formation of caries, for example inorganic fluoride salts, e.g. sodium, potassium, ammonium or calcium fluoride, or organic fluoride salts, e.g. amine fluorides, which are known under the trade name Olafluor.

[0160] The present compounds, e.g. those of formula (I), can be used also in household and all-purpose cleaners for cleaning hard surfaces. A cleaning preparation has, for example, the following composition:

<table><tr><td>25</td><td>0.01 to 5 wt-%</td><td>of at least one compound of formula (I), and</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3.0 wt-%</td><td>octyl alcohol 4EO</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1.3 wt-%</td><td>fatty alcohol C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>10</sub>polyglucoside</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3.0 wt-%</td><td>isopropanol</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>0 to 5 wt-%</td><td>of auxiliaries,</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ad 100 wt-%</td><td>water.</td></tr></table>

[0161] Also possible, in addition to the preservation of cosmetics, personal care and household products is the use of the inventive biocide in controlling microorganisms in technical products as well as in industrial and water containing systems and processes such as cooling towers, heat exchangers, boiler systems, other industrial process water, ballast water, wastewater treatment systems, reverse osmosis water processing but also swimming pools and spa facilities, pulp and paper manufacture, metal working fluids, leather manufacture, paints and coatings, aqueous emulsions, latexes, adhesives, inks, synthetic and protein-based glues, pigment dispersions, mineral slurries, caulks and adhesives, tape joint compounds, disinfectants, cleaners, textile fluids, or a system used therewith.

[0162] Moreover, the biocides of the invention are useful for controlling microorganisms in aqueous or water-containing systems, such as those present in oil and natural gas applications. Examples of such systems include, but are not limited to, injection and produced water, source water for waterflooding and hydraulic fracturing such as pond water and holding tank water, functional fluids such as drilling muds, workover fluids, hydrotest fluids, packer fluids, oil and gas pipelines or fuel.

[0163] In addition, the biocides may be employed in other areas. The biocides of the invention are suitable for use over a wide temperature range. In a preferred embodiment, the biocides are used in aqueous or water-containing systems at a temperature of 20° C or greater (e.g. within the temperature range 20-90°C). In further embodiments, the temperature of the aqueous or water containing system is 60° C or greater, or is 80° C or greater. The biocides are also further effective when a reducing agent such as a source of sulfide ion is present in the aqueous or water-containing system.

[0164] The formulation of the invention is typically used, for example, as

(a) a home care formulation, such as a disinfectant, all purpose cleaner, dishwashing liquid, descaling agent, a bath room cleaner, a toilet bowl cleaner, and/or

(b) a disinfectant and/or sanitary detergent of hard and/or soft surfaces, such as a floor cleaner, a glass cleaner, a kitchen cleaner, a bath room cleaner, a sanitary cleaner, a toilet bowl cleaner, a furniture cleaner, and/or

22------------------------------------------------

(c) a product for clean in place,

(d) a product for human skin, hair, oral cavity and mucous membranes, such as a disinfecting hand wash, a disinfecting hand rub, a skin lotion, skin cream, skin spray, mouth-wash, toothpaste, or intimate wash liquids, creams, sprays and gels,

e) product for animal uses, such as antiseptic washes, hoof disinfectants, udder disinfectants, dog shampoos,

or for the manufacture of said home care formulation (a), disinfectant and/or sanitary detergent (b), product for clean in place (c), product for human skin, hair, oral cavity and mucous membranes (d), product for animal uses (e).

[0165] In a further aspect the present invention is directed to a product comprising the formulation according to this invention, wherein said product is selected from the group consisting of home care formulation, disinfectant of hard and/or soft surfaces, sanitary detergent of hard and/or soft surfaces, and product for clean in place application.

[0166] The invention thus further provides a product selected from the group consisting of home care formulation, disinfectant of hard and/or soft surfaces, sanitary detergent of hard and/or soft surfaces, product for clean in place, all purpose cleaner, dishwashing liquid, descaling agent, bath room cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, floor cleaner, glass cleaner, kitchen cleaner, sanitary cleaner, furniture cleaner, wherein said product comprises a formulation containing the polymeric, ionic compound comprising at least 5 imidazolium groups and containing alkyl moieties as end groups, as described above.

[0167] Formulations for certain application fields such as home care, personal care, sanitary disinfection, hand disinfection, and especially for hospital disinfection, are advantageously applied as liquid formulations by means of a suitable dispenser, which allows applying the required dosage of the formulation. Formulations applied in this manner typically comprise the imidazolium polymer as described above (e.g. of the formula I), a liquid carrier (typically water and/or one or more alcohols, where the alcohol may also possess antimicrobial properties), and optionally further components, which are typically selected from surfactants and further antimicrobial agents.

[0168] The term "polymer", "polymeric ionic compound", "polyimidazolium compound", "imidazolium polymer", "antimicrobial polymer", and "polymer compound", as used within this specification including the following examples, denotes the polymeric salts of the invention, including those of the formula I.

[0169] The following examples illustrate the invention. Unless indicated otherwise, reactions take place at standard conditions, i.e. atmospheric pressure and room temperature (r.t.), which depicts a temperature from the range 20-25°C; over night means a period of 12 to 15 hours; all percentages are given by weight (w/w %), if not indicated otherwise.

[0171] The molecular weight of the polymeric ionic compounds is determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC):

A set three modified polyacrylate-copolymer (exclusion range 100 - 30 000 000 g/mol, NOVEMA Max Ultrahigh) columns of 8 mm width and 30 cm length is used. All columns are calibrated using a kit of poly(2-vinylpyridine) standards (620 to 2070000 g/mol; PSS Polymer Standards Service GmbH, Mainz, Germany) and pyridine (79.1 g/mol) as standards. Eluent is water containing 0.1% (w/w) trifluoroacetic acid and 0.1 M NaCl. The temperature of the columns is 35°C, the injected volume 100 microliter, the concentration 1.5 mg/ml and the flow rate 0.5 ml/min. UV detectors (232 nm) and refractive index detectors are used (DRI Agilent 1100 UV GAT-LCD 503).

[0172] The weight average molecular weight (Mw), the number average molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity PDI (Mw/Mn) of the polymeric ionic compounds are determined. Further, the GPC data reveal the percentage of species with molecular weight below 2000 g/mol in the present polymer product.

Approximately 100 grams of the diluted solution are filled into a stirred test cell fitted with a UP 010 membrane (Microdyn Nadir, 10 kD molecular weight cut-off). The test cell is kept at a temperature of 30 °C and pressurized with nitrogen up to a pressure of 10 bar.

[0181] By pressurizing the cell, the solvent and lower-molecular species get pressed through the membrane into the permeate. Larger species are retained by the membrane and stay inside the test cell. In the particular experiment, the setup is operated in a way that each volume of permeate produced is replaced by an equal volume of an acetic acid solution of pH 5.5. The experiment is run until a diafiltration factor of 10 is reached (i.e., an amount of permeate equal to 10x the feed volume is produced).
