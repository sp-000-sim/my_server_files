<h2>Description</h2><h3>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</h3><p>[0001] The present patent application is a National stage application of PCT application PCT/UA2016/000147 filed on December 19, 2016, which claims priority to Ukrainian patent application UA a201612062 filed November 28, 2016.</p><h3>FIELD OF INVENTION</h3><p>[0002] The invention relates to the field of microflora destruction technologies (bacteria, protozoan fungi, etc.), namely microorganisms in sessile state (hereinafter - biofilm), and can be used in medicine, industry, agriculture and various fields of technology for the destruction of biological films which are highly organized communities of bacteria in the extracellular polymeric substance (hereinafter referred to as the exopolymer matrix) formed on surfaces of different origin (biological, industrial, etc.).</p><h3>BACKGROUND</h3><p>[0003] From the current level of technology, which relates to the area under consideration, the closest, by the combination of features, to the claimed invention is a method of killing microorganisms in a sessile state, which involves contact of a biofilm (formed within 24 hours), in an exopolymer matrix of which there are coagulase-negative staphylococci, with an active substance that inhibits the activity of that bacteria, where a low molecular weight cationic peptide - varnerin is used the active substance at a concentration of varnerin of 16 - 128 <math>\mu\text{g}</math> / ml for 10 <math>\mu\text{g}</math> of biofilm, with subsequent incubation at 37 ° C for 24 hours, which leads to partial destruction of the exopolymer matrix due to the activation of autolytic systems of bacterial cells affected by varnerin (up to 30% of bacterial cells die in 24 hours) (V.P. Korobov, L. M. Lemkina, L.B. Filatova, TV Polyudova The destruction of biofilms of coagulase-negative staphylococci with cationic peptide varnerin.

It will initially transfer microorganisms from the sessile state to a planktonic form and at the same time affect the microorganisms themselves, which allows for the effective destruction of biofilms of various microbial origin, of different age and without changing the state of the surface on which it is fixed.</p><p>[0007] The task is solved in the method of destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, carried out by contact of the exopolymeric matrix of the biofilm with the active substance, so that according to the subject invention, the microorganisms are first transferred to the planktonic state by dissolving the biofilm matrix, and as the active substance they use an oxidant solution and a blocking agent OH - groups. This set of essential features provides a technical result, consisting in the fact that the proposed method primarily provides for the destruction of the exopolymeric matrix of a microbial biofilm, i.e. transfers microorganisms from sessile state to planktonic form, which itself leads to the weakening of microorganisms; and directly affects the microorganisms, regardless of their nature (bacteria, fungi, etc.) and the age of the biofilm.</p><p>[0008] From the current level of technology, which belongs to the considered area, the closest, by the combination of features, to the claimed invention, is the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, which is an aqueous solution of the active substance, which is used as a low molecular weight cationic peptide - vararin at a concentration of 16 - 128 <math>\mu\text{g}</math> / ml per 10 <math>\mu\text{g}</math> of biofilm, and the contact of the solution with the biofilm (formed within 24 hours) is carried out by incubation at 37 ° C for 24 hours that provides partial destruction of the biofilm exopolymeric matrix due to the secondary action of varnerin - activation of autolytic systems of bacterial cells affected by varnerin (up to 30% of bacterial cells die within 24 hours) (V.P.

This composition does not completely eliminate even the "young" biofilm (24 hours old) and the bacteria in it (up to 70%), when it mainly consists of mono and oligosaccharides, and to a lesser extent polysaccharides, and cannot be used for practical solutions to the destruction of biofilms for domestic or industrial purposes.</p><p>[0011] The problem to which the invention is directed is to improve the known composition for the destruction of microorganisms in the sessile state by changing its qualitative and quantitative composition, which will ensure the primary destruction of the exopolymeric matrix of the biofilm. Primarily, it will ensure the transfer of microorganisms from the sessile state to the planktonic form and simultaneously affect the microorganisms themselves, which allows the effective destruction of biofilms of various microbial origin, of different ages, without changing the state of the surface on which it is fixed.</p><p>[0012] The task is solved in the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state containing the active substance and the solvent with the fact that according to the subject invention, as the active substance an oxidizer solution and a substance that blocks OH - groups are used.</p><p>[0013] This set of essential features provides the technical result, consisting in the fact that the proposed composition provides primarily the destruction of the exopolymeric matrix of a microbial biofilm, i.e. transfers microorganisms from sessile state to planktonic form, which itself leads to the weakening of microorganisms; and directly affects the microorganisms, regardless of their nature (bacteria, protozoan fungi, etc.) and the age of the biofilm, which leads to the complete destruction of both the biofilm and the bacteria forming it.</p><p>[0014] Additional technical result, which consists in in-</p><p>creasing the efficiency of the process of killing microorganisms and expanding the range of chemicals depending on the properties of the surfaces that are processed, is ensured by using sodium peroxydisulfate as an oxidizing agent, and sodium hydroxide as a blocking OH group, and water as a solvent, having in mass. %:</p><p>Sodium peroxydisulfate not less than 0.5</p><p>Sodium hydroxide not less than 0.5</p><p>The remainder being water.</p><p>[0015] The proportion of components is due to the following: when going below the lower values of the components, the destruction of the biofilm does not occur, and the choice of the upper limit of the content of the components due to their solubility.</p><p>[0016] An additional technical result consisting in increasing the efficiency of the process of destroying microorganisms and expanding the range of chemicals depending on the properties of the surfaces being treated is ensured by using potassium nitrite as an oxidizing agent, and benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide is used as an OH blocking agent, and water as a solvent, with the following content of the components, mass. %:</p><p>Potassium nitrite not less than 0.5</p><p>Benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide not less than 0.5</p><p>The remainder being water.</p><p>[0017] The proportion of the components is due to the following: when going below the lower values of the components, the destruction of the biofilm does not occur, and the choice of the upper limit of the content of the components due to their solubility.</p><p>[0018] Additional technical result, which consists in increasing the efficiency of the process of killing microorganisms and expanding the range of chemical substances depending on the properties of the surfaces that are processed, is ensured by using N-methylmorpholine N-oxide as an oxidizing agent, and potassium tert-butoxide as an OH blocking agent, and dimethyl sulfoxide as a solvent, with the following proportion of the components, mass. %:</p><p>N-oxide N-methylmorpholine not less than 0.5</p><p>Potassium tert-butylate not less than 0.5</p><p>The solvent is the rest.</p><p>[0019] The proportion of the components is due to the following: when going below the lower values of the components, the destruction of the biofilm does not occur, and the choice of the upper limit of the content of the components due to their solubility.</p><p>[0020] An additional technical result consisting in increasing the efficiency of the process of killing microorganisms and expanding the range of chemicals depending on the properties of the surfaces being treated is en-</p>

As an oxidizing agent, any inorganic or organic substance or compound exhibiting oxidative properties is used, and as a substance that blocks OH groups, any inorganic or organic substance or compound is used that enhances the oxidative reactivity (oxidative) ability, which blocks the chemical reactions of the used oxidant with hydroxyl groups of polysaccharides exopolymer matrix, while maintaining the pH level of the composition. The components from which the composition is prepared for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, can be used, for example: an aqueous solution of sodium peroxydisulfate in the amount of 0.50-35.70 wt.%, and sodium hydroxide in the amount of 0.50-40.00 wt.%; an aqueous solution of potassium nitrite in the amount of 0.50-75.70 wt.% and benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide in the amount of 0.50-40.00 wt.%; N-methylmorpholine N-oxide in the amount of 0.50-50.00 wt.% and po-</p><p>tassium tert-butoxide in the amount of 0.50-35.00 wt.%. In dimethyl sulfoxide; an aqueous solution of potassium hexacyanoferrate in the amount of 0.50-31.65 wt.% and potassium hydroxide in the amount of 0.50-54.10 wt.%; ammonium cerium (IV) nitrate aqueous solution in the amount of 0.50-58.50 wt.% and formic acid in the amount of 0.50-85.00 wt.%; an aqueous solution of sodium bromate in the amount of 0.50-28.50 wt.% and sodium hydroxide in the amount of 0.50-40.00 wt.%; a solution of sodium dichromate in the amount of 0.50-30.00 wt.% and acetic acid in the amount of 0.50-80.00 wt.% in dimethyl sulfoxide; a solution of tetraalkylammonium chloride in the amount of 1.0-70.00 wt.% and methylsulfonic acid in the amount of 0.50-75.00 wt.% in dimethyl sulfoxide; a solution of dinitrogen tetroxide in the amount of 0.50-35.00 wt.% and citric acid in the amount of 0.50-80.00 wt.% in dimethyl sulfoxide; a solution of diethylamine in the amount of 4.50-45.00 wt.% and sulfur dioxide in the amount of 1.50-25.00 wt.% in dimethyl sulfoxide, as well as other similar systems containing organic and inorganic oxidizers and substances that block - OH group.</p><p>[0039] The choice of the quantitative content of the components is due to the following:</p><p>The minimum proportion of the components ensure the achievement of the technical result - the destruction of the biofilm matrix and the transfer of microorganisms from the sessile to the plankton form. If the amount is less than the lower value, the destruction of the exopolymer matrix does not occur, i.e. the technical result is not achieved, and the destruction of microorganisms occurs inside the exopolymer matrix, which increases the duration of the process and increases the consumption of the composition. The upper values of the components are due to their solubility limit in the solvent.</p><p>[0040] In the case when the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in the sessile state has a pH value of &lt;10.50, then a protective reagent is added to it - a compound to protect the hydroxyl groups of the polysaccharides of the exopolymeric matrix, which can be any of the compounds used for these purposes, : iodomethane, benzyl chloride, allyl bromide, triethylsilane, dimethyl sulfate, benzyl bromide, trichloroacetyl chloride, etc. in an amount of 0.01-5.00 wt.%.</p><p>[0041] If the composition for the destruction of microorganisms is also aggressive for the material of the object on which the biofilm is located, for example, metal surfaces, then a corrosion inhibitor is added to the composition, which can be any of the substances used for these purposes, for example: sodium N, N-diethyldithiocarbamic acid, dextrin, 3-methoxy-4-propargyloxy-benzoic aldehyde, sodium sulfur, methyl ethyl ketone, diisopropylammonium nitrite, etc. in an amount of 0.05-5.00 wt.%.</p><p>[0042] After preparation of the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, it is deposited on the object, the surface of which contains a biofilm.</p><p>[0043] As such an object, a plastic tray is used, on which biofilm was previously grown in the period from</p>

When using the composition with the content of components corresponding to the lower value of the range, the complete destruction of the exopolymeric matrix of the biofilm occurs within no more than 3 hours, while simultaneously destroying the bacteria, which, as a result of the destruction of the matrix, change from sessile form to planktonic, where the effectiveness of the biocidal properties of the proposed composition is significantly better. The test show that the bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae did not give positive results, indicating their complete destruction.</p><h2>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</h2><p>[0045] The proposed method and composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state is as follows.</p><p>[0046] Pre-prepare the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, for which dissolve the oxidizing agent and the substance that blocks the OH - group, in a solvent.
