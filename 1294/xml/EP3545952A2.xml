<p id="pa01" num="0001">The invention relates to the field of microflora destruction technologies (bacteria, protozoan fungi, etc.), namely microorganisms in sessile state (hereinafter - biofilm), and can be used in medicine, industry, agriculture and various fields of technology for the destruction of biological films which are highly organized communities of bacteria in the extracellular polymeric substance (hereinafter referred to as the exopolymer matrix) formed on surfaces of different origin (biological, industrial, etc.). Pre-prepare the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, for which dissolve the oxidizing agent and the substance that blocks the OH - group, in a solvent. An aqueous solution of sodium peroxodisulfate at a concentration of 10.00 wt.% And sodium hydroxide at a concentration of 15.00 wt.% Is used as components from which the composition is prepared for the destruction of microorganisms in the sessile state. Since the pH of the composition is greater than 10.50, no protective reagent is added. After preparation of the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, it is introduced into the object, the surface of which contains a biofilm. As a result of the introduction of the claimed composition for the destruction of microorganisms in the sessile state and its exposure for 10 minutes, the quantitative indicator of the enzyme urease of the material from the root canal was 0.00 µkat / I, which indicates that a complete destruction (dissolution) of the exopolymeric biofilm matrix occurred and bacteria that have passed into the plankton form are completely destroyed by the bactericidal action of the claimed composition.<img id="iaf01" file="imgaf001.tif" wi="55" he="68" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></p>

<heading id="h0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">The problem to which the invention is directed is to improve the known method of destroying microorganisms in the sessile state by replacing the active substance with the one that will ensure the primary destruction of the exopolymeric matrix of the biofilm. It will initially transfer microorganisms from the sessile state to a planktonic form and at the same time affect the microorganisms themselves, which allows for the effective destruction of biofilms of various microbial origin, of different age and without changing the state of the surface on which it is fixed.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The task is solved in the method of destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, carried out by contact of the exopolymeric matrix of the biofilm with the active substance, so that according to the subject invention, the microorganisms are first<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> transferred to the planktonic state by dissolving the biofilm matrix, and as the active substance they use an oxidant solution and a blocking agent OH - groups. This set of essential features provides a technical result, consisting in the fact that the proposed method primarily provides for the destruction of the exopolymeric matrix of a microbial biofilm, i.e. transfers microorganisms from sessile state to planktonic form, which itself leads to the weakening of microorganisms; and directly affects the microorganisms, regardless of their nature (bacteria, fungi, etc.) and the age of the biofilm.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">From the current level of technology, which belongs to the considered area, the closest, by the combination of features, to the claimed invention, is the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, which is an aqueous solution of the active substance, which is used as a low molecular weight cationic peptide - vararin at a concentration of 16 - 128 µg / ml per 10 µg of biofilm, and the contact of the solution with the biofilm (formed within 24 hours) is carried out by incubation at 37 ° C for 24 hours that provides partial destruction of the biofilm exopolymeric matrix due to the secondary action of varnerin - activation of autolytic systems of bacterial cells affected by varnerin (up to 30% of bacterial cells die within 24 hours) (<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>V.P.

<p id="p0010" num="0010">However, the known composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state does not provide the technical result of the claimed invention, which is due to the components, namely the use of the active ingredient varnerin, which is used in the composition, and acting directly on the microorganisms that, under biofilm conditions, are in the sessile phase, i.e. are difficult to access for varnerin, since the biofilm itself has a complex composition and is formed (up to 75%) from polysaccharides (cellulose, pectin, curdlan, dextran, levan, etc.), and its composition changes over time,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> which makes it difficult for varnerin to penetrate microorganisms, and the destruction of the biofilm itself is of a secondary nature, since varnerin does not directly destroy the exopolymer matrix of the biofilm, the destruction of which is due to the activation of autolytic systems of cells attacked by varnerin, and as a result, the method has low efficiency. This composition does not completely eliminate even the "young" biofilm (24 hours old) and the bacteria in it (up to 70%), when it mainly consists of mono and oligosaccharides, and to a lesser extent polysaccharides, and cannot be used for practical solutions to the destruction of biofilms for domestic or industrial purposes.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The problem to which the invention is directed to is to improve the known composition for the destruction of microorganisms in the sessile state by changing its qualitative and quantitative composition, which will ensure the primary destruction of the exopolymeric matrix of the biofilm.

The components from which the composition is prepared for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, can be used, for example: an aqueous solution of sodium peroxydisulfate in the amount of 0.50-35.70 wt.%. and sodium hydroxide in the amount of 0.50-40.00 wt.%; an aqueous solution of potassium nitrite in the amount of 0.50-75.70 wt.% and benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide in the amount of 0.50-40.00 wt.%; N-methylmorpholine<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> N-oxide in the amount of 0.50-50.00 wt.% and potassium tert-butoxide in the amount of 0.50-35.00 wt.% In dimethyl sulfoxide; an aqueous solution of potassium hexacyanoferrate in the amount of 0.50-31.65 wt.% and potassium hydroxide in the amount of 0.50-54.10 wt.%; ammonium cerium (IV) nitrate aqueous solution in the amount of 0.50-58.50 wt.% and formic acid in the amount of 0.50-85.00 wt.%; an aqueous solution of sodium bromate in the amount of 0.50-28.50 wt.% and sodium hydroxide in the amount of 0.50-40.00 wt.%; a solution of sodium dichromate in the amount of 0.50-30.00 wt.% and acetic acid in the amount of 0.50-80.00 wt.% in dimethyl sulfoxide; a solution of tetraalkylammonium chloride in the amount of 1.0-70.00 wt.% and methylsulfonic acid in the amount of 0.50-75.00 wt.% in dimethyl sulfoxide; a solution of dinitrogen tetraoxide in the amount of 0.50-35.00 wt.% and citric acid in the amount of 0.50-80.00 wt.% in dimethyl sulfoxide; a solution of diethylamine in the amount of 4.50-45.00 wt.% and sulfur dioxide in the amount of 1.50-25.00 wt.% in dimethyl sulfoxide, as well as other similar systems containing organic and inorganic oxidizers and substances that block - OH group.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">The choice of the quantitative content of the components is due to the following:<br/>
The minimum proportion of the components ensure the achievement of the technical result - the destruction of the biofilm matrix and the transfer of microorganisms from the sessile to the plankton form. If the amount is less than the lower value, the destruction of the exopolymer matrix does not occur, i.e. the technical result is not achieved, and the destruction of microorganisms occurs inside the exopolymer matrix, which increases the duration of the process and increases the consumption of the composition. The upper values of the components are due to their solubility limit in the solvent.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">In the case when the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in the sessile state has a pH value of &lt;10.50, then a protective reagent is added to it - a compound to protect the hydroxyl groups of the polysaccharides of the exopolymeric matrix, which can be any of the compounds used for these purposes, : iodomethane,<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> benzyl chloride, allyl bromide, triethylsilane, dimethyl sulfate, benzyl bromide, trichloroacetyl chloride, etc. in an amount of 0.01-5.00 wt.%.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">If the composition for the destruction of microorganisms is also aggressive for the material of the object on which the biofilm is located, for example, metal surfaces, then a corrosion inhibitor is added to the composition, which can be any of the substances used for these purposes, for example: sodium N, N-diethyldithiocarbamic acid, dextrin, 3-methoxy-4-propargyloxy-benzoic aldehyde, sodium sulfur, methyl ethyl ketone, diisopropylammonium nitrite, etc. in an amount of 0.05-5.00 wt.%.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">After preparation of the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, it is deposited on the object, the surface of which contains a biofilm.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">As such an object, a plastic tray is used, on which biofilm was previously grown in the period from January 2016 to September 2016 by continuously supplying water taken from a natural reservoir. During this period, a well-visible layer of an adhesion biofilm formed by bacteria previously found in water is formed on the surface of the tray in contact with the running water: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">The composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state poured into the tray. When using the composition with the content of components corresponding to the lower value of the range, the complete destruction of the exopolymeric matrix of the biofilm occurs within no more than 3 hours, while simultaneously destroying the bacteria, which, as a result of the destruction of the matrix, change from sessile form to planktonic, where the effectiveness of the biocidal properties of the proposed composition is significantly better. The test show that the bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae did not give positive results, indicating their complete destruction.</p>

<p id="p0045" num="0045">The proposed method and composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state is as follows.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">Pre-prepare the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, for which dissolve the oxidizing agent and the substance that blocks the OH - group, in a solvent. An aqueous solution of sodium peroxydisulfate at a concentration of 10.00 wt.% and sodium hydroxide at a concentration of 15.00 wt.% is used as components from which the composition is prepared for the destruction of microorganisms in the sessile state. Since the pH of the composition is greater than 10.50, no protective reagent is added.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">After preparation of the composition for the destruction of microorganisms in sessile state, it is deposited onto the object, the surface of which contains a biofilm.</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">As a treatment object containing a biofilm, the root canal of the 31st tooth was used in the treatment of chronic periodontitis with a biofilm, which was formed naturally by microorganisms characteristic of dental root canals, such as: Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Escherichia coli.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">As a result of the introduction of the claimed composition for the destruction of microorganisms in the sessile state and its exposure for 10 minutes, the quantitative indicator of the enzyme urease of the material from the root canal was 0.00 µkat/l, which indicates that a complete destruction (dissolution) of the exopolymeric biofilm matrix occurred and bacteria that have passed into the plankton form are completely destroyed by the bactericidal action of the claimed composition.</p>
