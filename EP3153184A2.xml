<heading id="h0001"><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method and system for disinfecting and/or sterilizing a room and/or apparatus placed in a room by means of chlorine dioxide gas.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Chlorine dioxide is historically typically used as a bleaching agent in the paper and pulp industry, but is also used as a biocide or oxidant, for example for water treatment or odour control. Chlorine dioxide has a relatively low oxidation potential compared to other oxidants, but has nevertheless a high oxidation capacity. Moreover, when used as a disinfectant, it forms less by-products compared to chlorine.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">In order to meet stability requirements, chlorine dioxide is preferably produced in batches. To this end, <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO2015136478A"><text>WO 2015/136478</text></patcit> describes an aqueous chlorine dioxide composition with a concentration of at least 4 gram chlorine dioxide per litre, a method for preparing such aqueous composition and a kit containing concentrated solutions of chlorite salt and bisulphate and persulphate salt.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">However, many production methods have limitations as reagents and/or by-products possibly are noxious for the room to disinfect and/or the product to disinfect. Therefore, chlorate is preferably not used in the food industry and corrosive agents can have an impact on metals, synthetic materials, electronics, measuring devices or medical apparatus. Therefore, the possible use of chlorine dioxide technology is largely limited, and mainly for applications in which chlorine dioxide is extremely useful. Thus, there is a need for new ways to release chlorine dioxide with a high purity in the room to treat without however reducing the generation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The present invention aims to offer a solution for one or more of the said problems or defects.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>SUMMARY</b></heading>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">To this end, the invention provides a method and a system for disinfecting a room with chlorine dioxide.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">To this end, the invention provides in a first aspect a method for disinfecting a room with chlorine dioxide gas, comprising the steps:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="dash" compact="compact">
<li>generating chlorine dioxide gas in a reaction cell;</li>
<li>releasing said chlorine dioxide gas from said reaction cell; and</li>
<li>transferring the released chlorine dioxide gas in the room to treat.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">More specifically, the generated chlorine dioxide gas is guided through a gas-permeable membrane before being released in the room to treat. In this way, possibly noxious agents can be stopped partially or completely by means of the gas-permeable membrane, so that damage to the room to disinfect can be suppressed partially and preferably completely.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">In a second aspect, the present invention provides a system for disinfecting a room with chlorine dioxide gas, comprising a reaction cell for generating and/or storing chlorine dioxide gas, a dispersing unit in fluidic connection with said reaction cell for dispersing the chlorine dioxide gas in said reaction cell in a room to treat and a gas-permeable membrane placed between said reaction cell and said dispersing unit. This offers the advantage that chemical agents that can possibly damage apparatus in the room to treat, can be stopped by said gas-permeable membrane.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">In a third aspect, the present invention provides the use of a method according to the first aspect of the invention for disinfecting a room in which apparatus, such as electronic devices, are placed. This offers the advantage that the used technology does not have a negative impact on the apparatus.</p>

<heading id="h0005"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Unless otherwise specified, all terms used in the description of the invention, including technical and scientific terms, shall have the meaning as they are generally understood by the worker in the technical field of the invention. For a better understanding of the description of the invention, the following terms are explained specifically.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">When "approximately" or "about" are used in the document together with a measurable quantity, a parameter, a period or moment, etc., variations of +/-20% or less, preferably +/-10% or less, more preferably +/-5% or less, still more preferably +/-1% or less, and even still more preferably +/-0.1% or less than and of the cited value are meant, as far as such variations apply to the invention that is described. It will however be clearly understood that the value of the quantity at which the term "approximately" or "about" is used, is itself specified.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">The citation of numeric intervals by means of end points includes all integers, fractions and/or real numbers between the end points, including these end points.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The term "disinfecting" is used as a synonym for the term "decontaminating" or "purifying" and refers to at least partially destroying one of more types of kind of plagues, pathogens or germs of a disease. Preferably, at least 90% of said pathogens or germs of a disease are destroyed, more preferably at least 97% and most preferably 100%. The term "kind of plague" is meant as a synonym of the term "noxious organism" and refers to each organism that is present unwantedly or that has a negative effect on a human, animal, plant and/or the environment.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> Examples of kinds of plagues are weed, micro-organisms, pathogens, fungi, larvae, insects, parasites, nematodes, algae, mites, rodents, bacteria, viruses, etc. The term "pathogen" or "pathogens" is used as a synonym for the term "pathogenic organism" and refers to several bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeasts and protozoa that can cause disease and/or death of a human, animal, plant or other biological organism. Pathogenic spores are spores that are produced by a pathogen. Specific examples of pathogens that produce spores, include, but are not limited to, members of the genera <i>Bacillus, Clostridium, Desulfotomaculans, Sporolactobacillus,</i> and <i>Sporpsarcina,</i> members of the <i>Phylum Apicomplexa</i> (such as <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>), and phytopathogenic fungi. In the context of the present invention, the term "disinfecting" is also meant as "sterilizing". When sterilising, a higher degree of killing of pathogens is obtained compared to disinfecting: degree 'log 6' when sterilising compared to degree 'log 5' when disinfecting. The sterilisation of a room is mainly carried out in applications where a high degree of hygiene is required, such as for example in rooms for food treatment or production, in medical rooms such as for example in hospitals, as well as in veterinary applications.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">The term "chlorine dioxide" or "ClO<sub>2</sub>" refers to a molecule indicated with the CAS number 10049-04-4 and appears as a gas at standard pressure and temperature. Chlorine dioxide has a greenish, yellow colour with a characteristic odour similar to chlorine and is a particularly efficient biocide that kill pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, fast and efficiently. Chlorine dioxide gas molecules can also kill atomized germs of a disease, and can also spread through tears and cracks in an article or a building or a room and thus reach each surface that is possibly contaminated with a germ of a disease. Chlorine dioxide is very well water-soluble, but compared to chlorine, it does not react with water. It appears in an aqueous solution as a dissolved gas. Chlorine dioxide is recognised as oxidative, possibly explosive, corrosive, toxic and environmentally dangerous. The boiling point of chlorine dioxide is 9.7°C at standard pressure.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">The term "sodium chlorite" refers to a chemical molecule with the gross formula NaClO<sub>2</sub> and is indicated with the CAS number 7758-19-2. The term "sodium bisulphate" refers to a chemical molecule with the gross formula NaHSO<sub>4</sub> and is indicated with the CAS number 7681-38-1. The term "sodium persulphate" refers to a chemical molecule with the gross formula Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and is indicated with the CAS number 7775-27-1. In an alternative embodiment, lithium, potassium, rubidium,<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> cesium and/or francium are used instead of sodium. This offers the advantage that counter-ions interfere minimally with the active agents in the aqueous compositions and thus do not jeopardize the obtained chlorine dioxide composition.</p>
<p id="p0018" num="0018">The term "reaction cell" is meant as a reaction vessel in which solid, liquid and/or gaseous agents can be loaded and discharges. Preferably, said reaction cell contains an aqueous solution in which chemical reactions can take place.</p>
<heading id="h0006"><b>Method</b></heading>
<p id="p0019" num="0019">In a first aspect, the invention provides a method for disinfecting a room with chlorine dioxide gas, comprising the steps:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="dash" compact="compact">
<li>generating chlorine dioxide gas in a reaction cell;</li>
<li>releasing said chlorine dioxide gas from said reaction cell; and</li>
<li>transferring the released chlorine dioxide gas to the room to treat.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">Chlorine dioxide can, in the context of the present invention, be generated via known methods according to the state of the art. Specific examples of combinations of reagents that can be used, include, but are not limited to: sodium chlorate, sodium chloride and sulphuric acid; sodium chlorate and hydrochloric acid; sodium chlorate, sodium chlorite, sodium chloride and sulphuric acid; sodium chlorate, sodium chlorite and hydrochloric acid; sodium chlorate, sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid; sodium chlorate, methanol and sulphuric acid; sodium chlorite and chlorine; sodium chlorite and hydrochloric acid and/or sulphuric acid; sodium chlorite, oxidizing gas and sulphuric acid; sodium chlorate, sodium chloride, hydrogen peroxide and/or methanol and sulphuric acid; sodium chlorite, sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid and/or sulphuric acid; and sodium chlorate, glucose and sulphuric acid. Other suitable combinations of reagents can also be used, such as for example electrochemical reactions in which chlorine dioxide is generated from sodium chlorite or sodium chlorate; or photochemical reactions in which chlorine dioxide is generated from sodium chlorite or sodium chlorate under influence of UV radiation, e.g. at 254 nm. Such methods are amongst other things described in <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO2005016011A"><text>WO 2005/016011</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="US4874489A"><text>US 4 874 489</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0004" dnum="US8652411B"><text>US 8 652 411</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0021" num="0021">Preferably, chlorine dioxide gas is generated in said reaction cell as a result of the reaction of chlorite with an activator in an aqueous solution. Thereto, in an aqueous solution, an alkali chlorite, shortly chlorite, is added to - and optionally stirred with<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> an activator such as preferably bisulphate; bisulphate and persulphate; citric acid; or a combination of one or more of said agents. The use of an agitator when mixing reagents in said aqueous solution is preferably avoided. Usually, other acids can also be used as an activator.</p>
<p id="p0022" num="0022">The release of said chlorine dioxide gas from said aqueous solution can take place by spontaneous diffusion of said chlorine dioxide gas in said aqueous solution to the gas phase above said aqueous solution. Subsequently, the chlorine dioxide gas can be brought into the aqueous solution. Alternatively, said chlorine dioxide gas can be released from said aqueous solution by purging the aqueous solution with air or nitrogen gas as a carrier gas. This purging is also referred to with the term "stripping", referring to the physical separation process in which one or more agents are removed from a liquid and included in the gas or vapour stream which was brought into contact with said liquid.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">The transfer of the released chlorine dioxide gas to the room to treat can be carried out by guiding the chlorine dioxide gas and eventually the carrier gas in which the outlet ends in the room to treat.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">More specifically, the invention provides a method for disinfecting a room with chlorine dioxide gas, in which the released chlorine dioxide gas is guided through a gas-permeable membrane before being released to the room to treat.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">In this way, possibly noxious agents can be stopped partially or completely by means of the gas-permeable membrane, so that damage to the room to disinfect can be suppressed partially and preferably completely. The presence of chlorate ions in mist drops is for example not desirable, specifically for disinfecting medical rooms. Chlorate can be present as contamination in the chlorite raw material, but can also be formed as a by-product during the production of chlorine dioxide from chlorite, especially when in an acid environment and/or at increased temperature. Chlorate ions from mist drops can namely precipitate in the room and on the present apparatus. However, chlorate is considered as a noxious agent for the human body, and the presence of chlorate in the environment should therefore be avoided. Moreover, the presence of corrosive agents in the reaction mixture before creating chlorine dioxide gas causes corrosion of the apparatus in the room to treat.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Any appropriate construction material can be used for the membrane, as long as the membrane is sufficiently porous to allow the flow of gases and sufficiently hydrophobic to prevent the passage of the aqueous solution. An appropriate gas-permeable membrane comprises an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene plate. The membrane can be provided as a composite with carrying or supporting materials to offer the structural strength that is needed in use. Such supporting materials can be selected from a diversity of polymer materials, such as for example, but not limited to, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene, and other materials, such as glass fibre tissues, felt and films. The pore size of the membrane can vary strongly, depending on the desired flow rate of chlorine dioxide through the membrane. The pore size cannot be so small that the chlorine dioxide gas flow is prevented through the pores and can moreover not be so big that the liquid flow through the membrane becomes possible. Said pore size is preferably comprised between 0.001 µm and 15 µm. The porosity of the membrane can vary strongly, also depending on the desired flow rate of chlorine dioxide through the membrane. Considerations with respect to the membrane strength also dictate the chosen porosity. In general, the porosity of the membrane varies from about 50% to about 98%. The thickness of the membrane is determined by the strength of the chosen material. The thickness of the carrying membrane varies between about 0.1 and about 2.0 mm. It is not essential for the present invention that the membrane is made of hydrophobic material throughout the thickness, as the surface of the membrane oriented towards an aqueous solution in the reaction cell is hydrophobic and as a result, the flow of the aqueous medium through the membrane can be prevented. The membrane can close off the discharge of the reaction cell in any desired geometrical form, in general flat form or in a tubular form.</p>
<p id="p0026" num="0026">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method according to the first aspect of the invention, in which said room is closed off partially or completely before disinfection. This offers the advantage that no or only a limited amount of chlorine dioxide gas and/or possibly present noxious agents can leak to the environment, as a result of which the effective concentration of chlorine dioxide in the room to disinfect remains maximal and there is no danger of undesired contact between said chlorine dioxide and/or possible present noxious agents and adjacent or contiguous rooms and the apparatus present in these rooms. Avoiding or at least significantly reducing the leaking of chlorine dioxide gas to contiguous rooms contributes to the safety of both professional operators and persons in the environment of the room to disinfect. Preferably, said room is closed off by means<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> of a substantially gas-impermeable closure. A closed room such as a closed article, a closed room or a sealed building should be understood as an environment in which substantially all fluidic connections with the environment are or were closed off, for example by means of plastic screens or other sheets, tape, isolation, sealants or combinations of that, and in which preferably, said screens are gas-impermeable. In a further embodiment, said closed room is made of a 'glove bag', a 'gas bag', an 'air bag' or an 'atmosbag'. Said closed room is preferably also provided with one or more in- and/or outlets allowing specific agents to be moved in and/or out of the closed room.</p>
<p id="p0027" num="0027">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method according to the first aspect of the invention, in which the chlorine dioxide gas is brought into the aqueous solution in the gas phase, for example by purging the aqueous solution with air, consequently is brought through a gas-permeable membrane and finally is released in the room to treat. Preferably, after the passage through the gas-permeable membrane, the chlorine dioxide gas is not absorbed in a second aqueous solution any more, but it is brought directly to the room to treat. As a result, the chlorine dioxide in the aqueous solution is released with an optimal efficiency in the room to treat, while at the same time, mist drops with chlorate ions as well as other possibly noxious agents are not or only strongly reduced released into the room.</p>
<p id="p0028" num="0028">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method according to the first aspect of the invention, in which said gas-permeable membrane has a pore size of less than 5.0 µm, preferably less than 2.5 µm. This offers the advantage that mist drops can be stopped by the gas-permeable membrane while gas molecules can diffuse without much resistance through the membrane. More preferably, said membrane has a pore size of less than 1.0 µm and still more preferably a pore size between 1 nm and 1000 nm. Most preferably, said membrane has a pore size between 5 nm and 500 nm, such as for example between 10 nm, 20 nm, 50 nm, 75 nm, 100 nm, 125 nm, 150 nm, 200 nm and 250 nm or any value between these values. Gas-permeable membranes with a too small pore size lead to a high pressure drop over the membrane as a result of which more energy is needed to transfer the chlorine dioxide through the membrane.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p>
<p id="p0029" num="0029">The term "aqueous solution" should be understood as an aqueous reaction medium in which reagents for the synthesis of chlorine dioxide gas can be brought. Reagents can contain chlorite and chlorate, as well as one or more activators.</p>
<p id="p0030" num="0030">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method according to the first aspect of the invention, in which de molar ratio chlorite : activator is lower than 4:1, and preferably about 2:1. A lower molar ratio chlorite : activator leads to a higher efficiency for the conversion of chlorite to chlorine dioxide. Said ratio chlorite : activator is preferably higher than 1:100, more preferably higher than 1:25 and still more preferably higher than 1:10. A too low molar ratio chlorite : activator leads to a slower activation of the chlorite.</p>
<p id="p0031" num="0031">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method according to the first aspect of the invention, in which said activator is a liquid or a solid at standard pressure and temperature. This offers the advantage that the activator has a low damp pressure, as a result of which the presence of the activator in the gas phase above the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide is relatively low at standard pressure and temperature. This offers the advantage that little or no activator with the chlorine dioxide in the gas phase is released into the room to treat. This is particularly advantageous when the activator has possibly toxic or noxious characteristics with respect to the environment or the apparatus in the room to treat. Hydrogen chloride, which is an activator for chlorite, will for example diffuse easily through the gas-permeable membrane and will have a corrosive effect on materials in the room to treat.</p>
<p id="p0032" num="0032">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method according to the first aspect of the invention, in which said activator is a solid at standard pressure and temperature. A solid as an activator offers the advantage with respect to a liquid that the damp pressure is lower at standard pressure and temperature, as a result of which the presence of the activator in the chlorine dioxide gas phase is lower. Thus, possible damage to the room to disinfect is avoided.</p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method according to the first aspect of the invention, in which said activator in acid form is an acid that does not dissociate in water and an acid gas at standard pressure and temperature. Activators such as for example bisulphate will become more acid in an acid environment to for example sulphuric acid, which spontaneously dissociates in<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> water and O<sub>3</sub>. The O<sub>3</sub> gas can then spontaneously go to the gaseous phase above the aqueous chlorine dioxide solution and diffuse through the gas membrane to subsequently be released into the room to treat. After reaction with water in the air of the room to treat, sulphuric acid can again be formed, which has a corrosive effect on the apparatus, and is also irritating and noxious for living organisms. Other examples of activators or additives to avoid are amongst other things bicarbonate.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">Said activator is preferably an acid, such as an organic acid or an inorganic acid, which can bring the pH of the aqueous solution within the pH range of 2 to 6, and preferably 3 to 5. The appropriate pH offers an optimal working area for activating chlorite. Preferably, said organic acid is a solid. Organic hydroxy carbon acids, such as for example - but not limited to - salicylic acid, lactic acid, acetyl salicylic acid and citric acid, are namely advantageous as they are good activators for generating chlorine dioxide. Most preferably, citric acid is used as an activator. Citric acid offers the advantage that it is highly soluble in water. As a result, a concentration of citric acid up to 500 gram per litre can easily be made and a highly concentrated, acid solution can be added to the aqueous reaction medium for obtaining the appropriate acidity. This offers the advantage that no citric acid precipitation is left behind in the reaction vessel, in the pipes and control valves of the system or on the gas-permeable membrane. Such precipitation would hinder the good operation of the chlorine dioxide generation system and of the gas-permeable membrane and eventually require more maintenance. Because smaller volumes of citric acid can be added, less waste products are moreover generated in the fumigation system.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for making an aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide in which chlorite and/or chlorate are activated by means of an activator. The activator can be selected from the group of acids, preferably organic acids and more preferably citric acid; bisulphate and/or persulphate; and hydrogen peroxide; or a mixture of two or more activators such as most preferably citric acid and hydrogen peroxide. This offers the advantage that a concentrated, stable solution of chlorine dioxide is obtained. The solution can subsequently be used for water treatment or disinfection applications.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method according to the first aspect of the invention, in which said chlorine dioxide gas from said aqueous solution is released by purging the aqueous solution with air. Air from the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> room to disinfect is preferably used to purge the aqueous solution with chlorine dioxide. Thus, chlorine dioxide can be stripped with an optimal efficiency out of said aqueous solution and can be swept away with the gas stream. The air flow rate for purging is preferably comprised between 0.001 m<sup>3</sup>/h per litre aqueous solution and 1.000 m<sup>3</sup>/h per litre aqueous solution. The air flow rate is thus partially dependent on the total amount of water. More preferably, said air flow rate is comprised between 0.005 m<sup>3</sup>/h per litre aqueous solution and 0.200 m<sup>3</sup>/h per litre aqueous solution, and still more preferably between 0.01 m<sup>3</sup>/h per litre aqueous solution and 0.10 m<sup>3</sup>/h per litre aqueous solution. An optimal air flow rate through the aqueous solution leads to an optimal air flow rate through the gas-permeable membrane and is thus also responsible for the good operation of said gas-permeable membrane. As an alternative for air, nitrogen gas can also be used for purging the aqueous chlorine dioxide solution under the same conditions as illustrated above.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method according to the first aspect of the invention, in which chlorite is activated by said activator in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide ensures the fast conversion of chlorate ions to chlorite ions. Thus, the release of chlorate ions, whether or not using a gas-permeable membrane, in the room to treat can be strongly suppressed. For some applications, such as mainly the food industry, chlorite is considered as a contamination that should be avoided and/or remedied. More preferably, chlorite is activated by citric acid in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. In an alternative embodiment, chlorite is activated by persulfate and/or bisulphate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. In an additional embodiment, the hydrogen peroxide is <i>in situ</i> generated.</p>

This offers the advantage that the total amount in the aqueous reaction medium is smaller, leading to a higher efficiency of the release of chlorine dioxide gas in the room to treat.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p>

More preferably, said room is previously conditioned at a relative humidity of 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69% of 70%, or any value between these values. Lower values of relative humidity offer the advantage that at a particular environmental temperature, less water is present in the air. The gaseous agents with corrosive characteristics that diffuse through the membrane, will, at lower relative humidity, be included slower in mist drops and will consequently not precipitate or precipitate less onto the apparatus in the room to disinfect.</p>

The use of higher temperatures than 30°C ensures that possibly present corrosive agents in the release chlorine dioxide gas have a more corrosive attitude in the room to treat. The use of lower temperatures than 15°C is possible, but leads to more difficulties to keep the relative humidity sufficiently low. Preferably, said method is carried out at a temperature above the boiling point of chlorine dioxide, such as for example at a temperature higher than 10°C at standard pressure.</p>

This can for example be realised by means of ventilation or repeated ventilation of the treated room. Alternatively, the chlorine dioxide gas can be neutralised. The term "neutralise" refers to the chemical neutralisation of a chemical agent, preferably by means of chemisorption, physisorption and/or decomposition. As a result of the neutralisation, the concentration of chlorine dioxide in said gas stream is substantially reduced. Said chlorine dioxide can for example be neutralised by means of, preferably intensive, contact with an aqueous solution comprising 10% in weight of NaOH and 10% in weight of sodium thiosulfate hydrate. Preferably, said chlorine dioxide is neutralised in a gas washer. In an alternative or preferably additional embodiment, a filter with a fixed chlorine dioxide adsorbant, preferably active coal, is used for adsorbing<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> remaining chlorine dioxide in the disinfected room.

Supply of reagents can be controlled by means of closure valves 32 and 33, respectively, by means of pump 22. The use of a pump becomes optional in cases in which water from a water pipe on pressure is used. In this way, reagents can be transferred to a reaction vessel 14, in which both reagents are brought into contact with each other during the reaction time. After this reaction time, the chlorine dioxide solution is ready for use, and it is transferred to a chlorine dioxide vessel 15.

In a second step, the formulated chlorine dioxide gas is transported over a gas-selective membrane with a pore size of 1000 nm. In order to stimulate the release of chlorine dioxide gas from the aqueous composition, the reaction mixture is purged with air.

Inox 304 species of 5 cm x 10 cm are exposed to the generated chlorine dioxide gas at a release regime of 720 ppm (vol.)h.

<p id="p0071" num="0071">The experiments of examples 7-15 were repeated in which a polyvinylidene difluoride gas-selective membrane with a pore size of 10000 nm was arranged in front of the outlet of the reactor. The results of the experiments are shown in Table 4. From the results, it can be derived that the provision of an appropriate gas-selective membrane suppresses the corrosive behaviour of the disinfection treatment significantly and completely, also at high purging flow rates. Hydrogen chloride diffuses through the said gas-permeable membrane, as a result of which the corrosive behaviour of the treatment cannot be suppressed significantly.
