The formulations comprise two or more curable materials, such that an average molecular weight of the curable materials in each formulation is no more than 500 grams/mol, such that each formulation features a viscosity of no more than 50 centipoises at a temperature of 35\u00b0 C. Kits comprising the formulations or formulation systems and additive manufacturing processes utilizing same are also provided. \n   \n   ",
